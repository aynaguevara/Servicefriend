Thank you for waiting Jassy! How may I help you today? 
I have an amount due on my account. I think it was because of netflix. How come I was charged when it says it's free?
I have free gift from globe worth netflix access and I activated it. Now, it's billed on my account.
Can you send me the screenshot of the said bill? The charges does not appear on my end. 
I cannot see the billing history but I believe its from Netflix. I havent received a notification that I will personally pay the access. It was automatically charged.
I see. Actually, the bill is not yet totally generated since the breakdown is also not yet available. The Php downpayment you made was for the billing period of December 17 to December 26. So that Php might be the prorated charge. Nothing to worry about your Netflix charges. 
from i still have remaining balance of why am I the one paying this? I cancelled it already
I can see that. But if you say its a prorated charge, how come my other colleagues who availed of a plan same as mine dont have any charges on their account?
Before your bill generated, you have a credit balance of which is for the current bill period. But since the system generated an early cut-off date which is December 26, it did not complete the whole bill cycle and automatically prorated from to 
Then, the you made will take effect on the next bill period.
Okay. Thank you. But do I have to worry about Netflix? even if I canceled it already? How do I make sure that it wont charge any fee on my globe account?
Were you able to receive a text message from Netflix?
There's nothing to worry about getting charged from Netflix if you have successfully unsubscribed to it. 
I just entered the code and thats all Ive got. No text from Netflix.
You may also text STOP to to make sure that you are already unsubscribed to Netflix.
Sorry, but your request cannot be processed at this time. To cancel your subscription, you may visit and select cancel membership. Thank you!
I see. It appears that you have no active subscription on Netflix. 
Thank you. Lastly, what does free access of netflix means? what's the scheme of gift of netflix from globe?
I got your message, Jassy. Don't worry - I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
Hey! I'm back! Sorry to keep you waiting. That's the worth of your 6 months access to Netflix.
Does it mean i can consume watching movies for free?
It will be deducted to your data allocation. 
What does it mean?
It's the Free access to your Netflix but Netflix doesn't have it's own data allocation.
Hey there! Still need my help? I'm just here if you need me.
Im just worried that Netflix will charge me total of on my account.
It depends on your usage.
But I already canceled it?
Don't worry, you will not be charged because you are enrolled to Standard Definition video quality with only 1 concurrent user allowed. 
I'm done for today. Is it okay to chat with you tomorrow? I'm available from 9:00AM-5:30PM.

Yes. Actually that's my lolo uncle's number. He wanted to avail of the free points so he asked me to send you a message. Thank you!

No problem. Wait

By the way, Iג€™m always here if you have any questions on your Globe Postpaid plan.
Thanks. By the way, why was it hard to send and receive messages? It started a week or two ago. My phone shows signal but I couldnt send and receive a message. My friends can't call me either. My location is Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. Thank you
I got your message, Xha. Don't worry - I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
Have you tried to restart your phone?
Yes. Actually, my workmates experienced it too.
We have been bothered and frustrated this holidays because our friends and relatives couldn't contact us here.
May I know the exact experience?
Most of the time our phones indicate No Service. At times it has signal but we can't receive and send a message. I asked a friend from manila to send me messages but I didn't receive on time. It was quite a problem for 2 weeks now
As checked, there's no outage within your area. Are you inside a building? Is the experience same when you got out from there?
Yes but I experience the same at home, too. Last week, a personnel from Globe Solano said that they were fixing a tower last week.
I don't know if my sim is the problem. Should I change it already?
If that was the personnel told you, and most of you is experiencing it, you should just wait until the tower is fixed.
I'm almost done for today! Just message me anytime and I'll get back to you soonest. You can reach me from 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM daily. Enjoy the rest of the day!ֲ

Wala pa ko nari-receive sa email ko
Can you double check? 
I did
Ganito ba lagi kayo? Delayed lagi?
Ah okay, so di mo pala sya natatanggap. Pero kasi generated na sya sa system namin. 
osd_3rd@ymail.com
Yan po yung email ko. May underscore after ng osd
Tama naman yung nasa record ko.
Even sa text wala ako nare-receive
Actually may ongoing system activity kasi na maka-aapekto sa bill deliveries. Aware naman ako sa issue na yan. Pero hindi naman lahat nakaka-experience ng bill delay. 
That's why I'm checking kung nareceive mo na. 
As checked, marereceive mo sya this end of December.
So can you pls do a follow up regarding my concern?
Don't worry kasi we assure you na i-aadjust namin ang bill due date mo.
And then kailan ang deadline?
Yun nga, Dec. 30th or 31st mo sya marereceive.

why is it different from my spotify subscription?
May I know what it is?
my spotify subscription is until nov 20
per my contract
see my contract details

You payment will be on January 
I see. But that includes 2 mos of bill already right?
Your Plan just got activated. You don't need to hurry your bill. 
I see. I just dont want to pay bills accumulated for 2mos. Ruin my monthly budget
Lol
Your Plan just got activated last Dec. 24, the're no need to rush.
You only settled the advance payment right? 
It will cover the bill period from Dec.24 to Jan. 23, 
I see. So no need to pay for this month.
Thanks ge
Gie*
Yes. Is there anything else I can help you with?
None for now. I'll reach out to you if i have concerns about my plan. Thanks much
Happy new year!

hi
Hi! :)
what is wrong with the gservice of my other number.
Thank you for your message.
its always like this
Let me check...
i cannot proceed because i can only type my nickname
i cannot type in the account name option
and in my other account i cannot view my bill in globe.com.ph
it says ""sorry this billing statement is not available for this account"
its not available but its showing me how much should I pay for my account
how can it show me how much if my billing statement is not available?
GService as of now is having a system error. But you can check it thru MyAccount.
and in my other account i cannot view the pdf file or download it
yes im using my account and if i want to view my bills its telling m its not available for this account
so in your my account there is still a system error?
when will that error be fixed?
and why is it that only my other account that I cant access the gservices?
you've been telling me that for weeks now that you have a system error
Sorry for the inconvenience. I've already processed request for bill resend. Kindly monitor your Email within the day. 
thank you so much.

why am I charged with the nba if i have a 6month free subscription?
To clarify, the free subscription is for the access of the app. It will be charged on your data allocation, if consumed it will be charged on top of your bill.
if its free for my account for 6months. why am I charged?
its in my plan that i have a free 6months subscription for the nba.
iv told you this already that I called to ask how to activate my nba account.
then your agent told me to go to 
he told me a wrong info and you told me to wait for my bill for you to assess my problem

yes i was told by your agent to register when i asked him how to activate my free nba.
he told me to go to then nba and etc.
he told me wrong information ang im being charged for it?

Did you already informed it through hotline? Because, it's a valid charge considering that you registered it on your end. Let me know the feedback. Okay?
yes i called already. and still no response or update about my complain.
valid charged?because of a wrong information given to me?its a valid charge?how come?
i asked your agent how can i use the free subscription and he said to register to your 
and im being charged for the wrong info?
the agent that ive talked to with my complain told me that they will check and listen to the recording of our conversation with your incompetent agent. still no response about my complain.
and you also told me to wait for my bill for you to asses the situation. you have my bill and then your telling me its a valid charge?
I got your message, Loloy. Don't worry - I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
okay thankyou
You're already charged with it. You can deactivate it after your subscription expires. And after that, you can activate your free access.
Here's how:
1.) Open the NBA App
2.) Select A Game
3.) Click on ""Buy to Watch Now"
4.) A Globe Popup Should Appear
5.) Login/Register
6.) Verify Phone Number 
7.) Input Mobile Number
8.) Punch in the one time verification number
9.) Tap on ""Verify Phone Number"
10.) Screen should show ""It's Game Time"
11.) Sub can now watch NBA Games

As I've checked, you've been registered to Spotify premium twice. Have you followed the steps to activate it for free?
Not yet
How
Can you activate it for me and adjust the bill?
If you're the one who have done this, I can't adjust it prior to your account.
I didnt registered to the spotify
It automatically charged
You did not use Spotify?

To activate your free Spotify Premium, please visit the link and enter your 11-digit number.

Hello po
Hi! :)
Yan bang babayaran ko sa January 11 ?
Pst
Bakit po magkakaiba ang bakasulat kung magkano ang babayaran ?
Your Globe Postpaid bill is now digital and ready for viewing! To access your latest bill, simply click on or copy this link to the browser of a tablet or laptop. For your security, a one-time verification code will be sent via text message. Make sure you're connected to the internet and a PDF viewer is enabled on your device. Thank you!
Reply naman po
Feedback please
For a moment please.
Sasagutin ko yan, may tanong lan ako.
Is this account listed under your name?
Opo
TOTAL AMOUNT DUE: 
Yung isa po bakit lang ?
Due Date: Jan 11, 
Paano po naging ganyan kalaki?
Sa GServices ka ba nag-check?
Opo
Refresh mo yung phone mo, baka hindi nag-uupdate yung app mo eh.
Wala naman pong charges
Nareceive mo na ba bill mo?
Click mo yung link na nareceive mo para ma-view mo yung bill mo, nandun yung details and breakdown.
Oo nga po . Ang tinatanong ko lang bakit magkaiba yung bill ?
Pakifix naman po tiyaka bakit ang laki po ng charges ?
Hindi nga kasi nag-uupdate yung GServices mo.
Updated naman po sa playstore
Bakit 2 bills ?
Hindi po ba pwede yung magbayad ako ng kalahati muna ?
Tapos sa jan.11 yung kalahati ?
Sandali lang.
Hindi naman po ako lumagpas sa 3gb data ngayon
Minsanan na lang po ako nagdedata ehh bakit lumaki ng ganyan ?
Teka, teka. I-che-check ko. 
I-aanalyze ko tapos i-eexplain ko sa'yo ha. Pasensya ka na, di naman kasi ako ang gumagawa ng bill mo. System generated yan.
Pero i-eexplain ko sa'yo. 
Sige po .
Pangalawang bill mo na to diba?
Opo kasi wala pong sinabi ngaying december kung ilan ang magiging bill ko
Ngayong*
Pero yung bill mo nuna, okay na?
Po?
Malaki rin po binayaran doon .
Yung first bill mo, okay na yun?
Pero bayad na
Okay na po yun
Nagtaka ppo ako naging dalawa na yung bill ko eh pangalawa pa lang po itong reminder
Panong dalawa?
Dalawa yung nakasulat sa bill number eh
Isa lang yan.
As checked, yung charges mo nakuha mo sa web browsing. 
Additional charge sya sa bill mo.
Paano kapag ideactivate niyo na lang yung pagwewebrowse ko? Para hindi na lumaki ang babayarin .
Clarify ko lang na itong bill ay sakop noong 11 Nov 16 hanggang 10 Dec 16.
Hindi pwede yun eh. Ang gawin mo na lang i-monitor mo na lang yun data usage mo. Gawin mo i-check mo sa mas updated yun.
Pakiexplain po .
Yung nag instruct po kasi sa amin eh pwede po raw yun .
I-deactivate yung pag-ba-browse mo?
Hindi po . Kapag nakagamit ka na po ng 3gb data . Hindi na po kapag pwede gumamit ng data until magreset na naman
Ah okay. Basta next time ha. 
Para di ka na magkaroon ng extra charges.
Ehh paano po yun ?
Hindi niyo ba gagawan ng paraan ?
May magsesend naman sa'yo ng notification message diba. Yun yung mga unbilled charges mo, ibig sabihin yun na yung running usage mo outside your Plan.
Meron kang spending limit na Kapag lumagpas ka dyan, maba-barred na ang outgoing services mo. 
Po?
Babayaran pa ba yung mga charges ko ? Eh plan nga po diba ? Eh di yun lang dapat babayaran . Bakit po nadadagdagan?
Syempre naman. 
Hindi ko po maintindihan kung anong services ang meron kayo 
Yun na nga diba. Yun ang Plan mo. kaso na-exceed ka. Sumobra. Lumagpas. Nadagdagan.
Syempre babayaran mo yun dahil ikaw ang gumamit nun.
Dapat alam mo ang data usage limit mo. Kung may 3GB ka sa Plan mo, ibig sabihin 3GB lang ang data allowance na meron na covers ng Plan mo.
Kapag lumagpas ka, syempre additional charge sa'yo.
Oo nga po 3gb lang ang meron doon kaya dapat kapag naka3gb na ako eh di hindi na dapat ako nakakabrowse o nakakadata di po ba ?
Kaya ka nga may Plan. Kumbaga, may limit. Hindi sya unlimited.
Hindi siya unlimited"" pero bakit nakabrowse pa rin ako ?
Makakagdata ka pa rin. Makakagamit ka pa rin, pero charges on top of your monthly bill na yun. Di pwedeng kusang titigil yun kapag na-reach mo ana ng data cap.
I mean, yung Plan mong data HINDI unimited.
*unlimited
3GB lang. HINDI unlimited. Yun ang tinutukoy ko.
Ok po . Eh paano po ngarod kapag sa ibang sim . 1gb data capping po kapag nakaabot ng sa 1gb hindi na nakakadata?
Kaya nga ina-advise ngcsbus agm amin ang mga subscribers na i-monitor ang data usage nila para maiwasan ang additional charge.
Kapag alam mong paubos na or naubos na ang 3GB data allowance mo, initiative mo na lang yun na i-off na lang muna ang data connection mo para di sya tumatakbo diba. 
Matanong ko lang po . Kailan ba nagrireset yung 3gb data ko ?
Baka naman naka-set sa settings nila na kapag nakaabot na sa 1GB ang usage nilam eh mag-isstop na. Pwede kasi yun eh.
Check mo sa phone settings mo > Data usage
Every 11th of the month nag-rereset ang data mo. 
Hindi po . Gumagamit po ako ng wifi modem . Ganoon po ginagawa ko sa ibang sim . Hindi na po kapag makakabrowse
Ok po sige .
Depende siguro sa SIM, naka-Postpaid ka kasi.
Ok po . Pakifix nga po at tulungan ako kasi malaki na po babayaran ko eh .
Wala na ko magagawa sa bill mo. 
Next time na lang, hinay hinay sa pag-ba-browse para di na maulit.
Hindi na ako masyadong gumagamit ng data eh
Kasi ang charge nyan is P5 per 15 minutes. Kahit di ka magbrowse basta naka-on ang data connection mo, merong charge yan.
Matanong ko lang po . Pwede po bang magpalit ng promo ?
Oo ngayon. Pero dun sa bill period na nabanggit ko, dun yun pumasok sa period na yun.
Aling Promo?
Promo po .
Yung GoSURF mo?
Opo .
Mas makakamura
May tumawag pa po kasi sa akin na mag aadd daw ng youtube 1gb data po ata yun . Tapos hindi po siya nakinig . Sinasabi ko pong hindi na ako lalagpas ng 3gb next bill pero itry ko lang po . Paano po kapag hindi ko gusto ?
Sino daw sya?
Hindi ko po alam .
Nakalimutan
Hindi nagpakilala sa'yo?
Taga saan daw sya? From Globe ba?
Opo globe
 yan po
Yan po . Narecord ko po
myLifestyle Plan po ba yung akin ?
Hindi nagpe-play 'yung sinend mong audio e.
Nagpeplay na po ba ?
Hindi pa din sya nagpe-play. Pero, hayaan mo na. As checked kasi, that number is not from Globe. Baka ginamit lang 'yung pangalan namin. 
Talaga ? Eh bakit po sabi doon kapag may mga ibang katanungan tawag po ako sa ? ata yun
Alam niya po yung plan ko ganoon
sabi niya pa na 2 pesos per mb po
Pwede naman kasi masearch 'yung mga ganung bagay. Pero, sige. Che-check ko ulit yung number.
sige po
Aside from that, would there be anything else?
wala na po . Check mo na lang po ulit yung number
From Globe man 'yun o hindi, I'm not allowed to tell din eh. Pero ikaw, it's up to you naman kung mag aavail ka. 
ay hindi po ba from globe yun ?
I'm not allowed to tell eh.
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Hi may i know when is my cut off date and Bill deadline
Thank you for your message.
Hmm... Let me check your plan details for you.
Thanks.
Your billing cut-off date is every 26th of the month and you have due balance that's why you don't yet have due date.
Ah.. may balance of how much..
You don't have balance yet. But you have an advance payment.
Ah.. estimated nyomga kelan ako mag kaka bill
Mga 7 days after ng billing cut-off mo?
Mga january 2 due ko.. ??
Nope,, yung due date mo is 21 days after ng billing cut-off mo.
So wala pa ako sa cut off??
O nag cut off nako mg dec 26??
Nung*
Ganito kasi yan. Meron kang billing cycle. from 26 last month to 25 from the next month. For example, Nov. 27 to Dec. 26 ayan yung billing cycle. Yung bill mo mage-generate after 7 days ng billing cut-off mo tapos yung due date is 21 days after ng billing cut off mo. Sa case mo yung billing cut-off ay every 26th of the month.
Ah ok.. so ang cover ko lang is from dec 5 to 26 nag cut off na.
Yes, ganun na nga. 
Mag kakaroon na ba ako ng tx notification before my due date??
Yes.
Ok thanks..
Welcome. Meron pa ba kong maitutulong sayo?
Ah.. inform na lang kita agad if my concerns pa ako.. thanks and godbless.. advance happy new year..
Okay. Sayo din.

Pwede ba malaman saan at kailan ka nagbayad?
D2 po sa teacher sa amin tru gcash
Ang teacher nyo ang nakipag-coordinate? Kailan ka nagbayad?
Sa gcash po ng isang teacher d2 sa amin po ako nagbayad...
Naactivate po kc ung plan ko nong oct. 31. Tpos cut off ko is every 12th of d month. So from activation to cut off meron lang akong 13 days. So x 13= 
Pero ung dumating s akin n bill is super laki kaya nagreklamo ako. Sabi nong agent na pinagkuhaan ko ng plan e irereport daw nya. Ung bayaran ko lng daw is lang, tpos un nagbayad ako wala kcng pangchange kaya nlng binayad ko.
Yan po ung first bill po which is pro rated pa dapat kc d namn me nakagamit ng buong month
Yes, first bill is pro rated. Wait mo nalang yung next bill mo kasi kung hindi nag-reflect dun yung dapat na credited dun namin i-bibill adjust.
Kasi kung system error sya next bill ma-crecredit naman yung binayad mo. So hindi masasayang binayad mo kasi mag-re-reflect naman next bill eh.
Ung next po na bill ko is ....
Ung outstanding balance ko e di nabawasan...
Sorry for the long wait, Emily. Chineck kong mabuti yung account mo and nakita kong na-charge ka sa iyong first bill for para sa Unli-text to All network mo which is invalid.
Wait, explain ko sayong mabuti yung computation ng bill mo para mas maintindihan mo. Hang on. 
Nung nag-compute ako, ang total due mo lang dapat nung first bill mo is Since may advanced-payment ka naman amounting to upon application, nalang yung kailangan mong i-settle. 
Ahm mam kc po ung plan ko is Unli call to globe and tm, unli txt to all network at 3 gb na data lang. Unli txt to all net po xa kc 3gb instead na 5gb.
Bakit po ako ichacharge ng txt sa other net?
System error kasi. Pero don't worry, I will do the necessary adjustment for that. Explain ko nalang muna yung bill mo para mag-come up tayo sa magiging total bill mo. 
Ok cge...
Thanks! Okay, going back. Credit ko nalang pala muna yung invalid charges sa bill mo to make your bill balance clear. 
Ok cge...
Ohh! Sorry my bad! Nung ni-review ko talaga yung bill mo tama pala yung bill mo valid siya.
Kasi nag pa-downgrade ka ng GoSurf mo tapos nag-pa add ka kaya ganun. 
Kaya ganun yung charges mo. So nung second bill mo hindi nag-bago dahil wala naman talagang system error.
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
Wat do you mean po wlang error?
Na tama yung first bill mo kasi ni-review ko yung bill mo. Na nag-pa downgrade ka ng GoSurf at nag-pa add ng Unli All Net Text kaya ganun yung bill mo.
Kasi kung sa second bill mo dapat na-itama na yung kung may mali sa bill mo kaso valid talaga yung charges kaya wala dapat i-adjust.
Ung 1st bill ko po e pero ung pinabayaran po sa akin ni mem pie e lang. Pero ung binayad ko po is kc wlang pangchange, so ung payment ko is over ng 89, tpos ung next bill ko is tama na po ung bill ko, pero d ba dapat ung outstanding balance ko is - 89= nlng kc may excess payment ako sa 1st bill ko. D b?
I mean tama yung na-billed sayo kasi nag-ka charges ka dahil sa pag-changes ng plan inclusions mo.
If you want, we can continue to talk tomorrow. ג˜÷ן¸ I'll get back to you first thing in the morning tomorrow.

Hi Gie
My number automatically registers as ""Marlo"" when I'm added to groups. Was my number somebody else's before it was mine?
Groups in Viber*
This number may have once been in use in the past, but once an account has been terminated, the mobile number is kept inactive in our system for a certain period (6 mos minimum). Any concerns related to the previous owner remain with the old account. Once the inactive period has ended, the number is issued to you as a fresh account with no history.

Di yung na balance ko magkaka interest na naman pag di ko nabayaran
Hindi naman sya magkaka-interest. Bali ang mangyayari, maidadagdag sya sa next bill. First bill mo pa lang ba?
Hindi po pangalawa na sana ngayung december kaso nga nakaadvance daw ako kaya by january na ako magbayad?
Dun kasi sa in-advance mo, hindi pa na-credit lahat 'yung kailangan mong i-settle.

And for HOOQ.

 2: Enter your name, email address, contact number and password. Check the terms and conditions box once you read and fully understood it. Click Next. 
Step 3: On the Availment Method page, select ג€Globe Activation Codeג€ to register the code provided.

When i registered for hooq, it says my number is already an existing account
Did you use your postpaid mobile number?
Yes
I just got my phone this week
There is no way i registered it b4, unless my number is a recycled number n the previous owner did registered.
Nope all the transactions of the owner before are deactivated.

Hello?
I need help.
Hi! :)
How can i help you?
I want to subscribe to spotify premium.
Thank you for your message.
Let me check...
But i cant.
Just want to subscribe for 1 day premium.
What now?
You can activate your Spotify premium here:
I registered for 3 months. I just want for 1 day.
Wait, let me clarify this one. Do you mean you want to subscribe to a 1 day Spotify Premium? Not 30 days?
Yes just one day but i already registered to a 3 month spotify premium.
So, what do you me to do with your 3 month Spotify Premium subscription?
Can i still cancel it?
Of course!
But first, may I have an screenshot of your successful subscription to Spotify Premium to validate it?
I cant go back anymore to the page where i had a message from spotify that i was already premium.
I see.
Yes.
How much is this spotify i subscribed right now?
Hmmm... As per checking, you don't have a standalone Spotify Premium in your account. What you only have is your 3-month free access to Spotify Premiium.
So this is still free? This doest go to my bill?
*doesnt
Yes! But since it is a free access, every time you stream, it will be deducted to your GoSurf.
Ahh okay i get it. Its a free premium but if i look for new songs it get deducted to my 3GB data? Is that is?
You got it right! 
By the way, how do you want me to call you? Do you have a nickname?
So what if i will use a wifi router. I aint using my data on that. So what is the difference?
My real name is vince actually but my friends call me binsoy or soy.
So, which one do you want me to call you?
Do you want me to call you Vince, Binsoy or Soy?
Soy will be okay. Haha
Soy, same as soy sauce? Hahaha.. Just kidding! 
Hahaha, yeah that could be it. Lol
Hahahahaha... Cool! 
By the way, if you'll use a Wi-Fi instead of your mobile data, your GoSurf won't be deducted.
Ahhh okay thats. Good that globe has a free premium access. This is great.
I know right! 
So, is there anything else I can help you with?
No more. Thank you so much.
Alright, Soy! Just send me a message if you'll be needing my help, okay?
Okay. Thanks gie
You're always welcome!
Have a wonderful day! Ba-bye! 
Hi, is there a way for me to find out my mobile data usage?
Thank you for your message.
Hmm... Let me check your current usage for you.

1. Download GServices App. in Play Store/ App Store.

Ang number mo ay pwedeng gamit na. Pero huwag kang mag-alala dahil once na ang account ay terminated na, ang mobile number ay mananatiling hindi active sa system namin sa loob ng 6 na buwan. Any concerns na related sa previous owner ay mananatili sa lumang account. 
Once na ang inactive period ay matapos, ang number na i-issue sayo ay bago at walang anumang history.

Hello! I'm almost done for today. I'll be here a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want. 
Hi. Can I request a breakdown of my billing? I haven't received anything yet on my email
Good morning! 
Sorry for the inconvenience. Your bills can now be viewed via MyAccount and will be delivered in a few days. And I assure that I adjusted your due date accordingly. 
Your new due date is January 16, And your next billג€™s due date will return to the normal schedule. 
Acct. Was not up to date. Billing didn't reflected my cash out for the unit. Talked to a customer agent yesterday, I was advised my total bill is only not 
For a first time postpaid customer, I must say I was disappointed.
May I know the details of your payment for this bill? 
But I was advised I only need to pay on Jan. 16. And the bill that they sent me and appears on my Gservice acct. Is wrong.
Is your Postpaid number is correct Because, as I checked, you don't need to pay this amount P1, because it was credited from your advance payment. 
Correct number. I was advised yesterday by customer representative: Arvin w/ Employee number That for Nov. 9 to Dec 12 billing I only need to pay wich is due on Jan. 16.
Lease advise if that is ccorrect
Please advise if this is correct
Have you already checked your bill on My Account? So I can guide you better.
No. My bill doesn't appear on My account
Upon checking your account, you don't have any balance to pay, as a matter of fact you still have a remaining credit balance. That you can used to pay your future bills.
Hello! I haven't heard from you in a while. Still need help with anything? 
Nope. All good thanks

Hi, Gie. May I know what services I have like Hooq, Spotify, NBA subscriptions? On how to avail them?

And upon checking my subscription, it is managed by Globe and is recurring? I just want to avail the trial but it is already billing me monthly?
HOOQ
To activate HOOQ, register/log in at http://hooq.tv on your PC and enter the activation code sent via text. 
Thank you! Another question, my voucher doesnt work?
It says not accepted
Also, are you a robot?
Of course not. I'd be the most beautiful bot if I am. 
May I know the exact email address and mobile number you have used?
Haha! Ayos :)
Email is and number is 
Tama naman ang mga information na provided. Can you just try to register again to get a new activation code?
Okay na po yun activation code from hooq. Yun lang pong free hooq for 3 months ayaw tanggapin.
Hindi ka nga robot! Yey!!! Thank you thank you!!! :)
Haha, to naman. Di naman talga ko robot. Ibig sabihin ba nun may subscription ka na sa HOOQ?

Yes, of course! Hehehehe...
Hello, Mak-Mak! Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Can I increase my mobile data allocTion size?
Hmmm. Let me check for a moment, okay? 
As I check your account, Mak-mak, yes. You can still upgrade your GoSurf from to a higher variant with a higher data allocation but the excess amount will be charged on top of your monthly billing statement.
Like for example if we changed your GoSURF to GoSURF you will be charged on top of your monthly billing statement.

Yes, pwede mo ipababa yung amount ng plan mo pero yung Monthly Service Fee mo, same pa rin. Kumbaga, yung difference magiging consumables.
Ano po bang proseso kung ibaba ko?
Ive-verify lang natin yung account mo to proceed. Kaso, within contract pa rin yung plan mo eh. Kailangan mo mag-settle ng admin fee which is 
I personally suggest not to continue your plan to downgrade kasi same pa rin naman babayaran mo monthly.

Both number. Confusing lang po ung sa monthly recurring fee. For last tym i called overpayed ako ng Now i have to pay 
For the i payed in advance upon application. Now i have to pay 99 without exceeding my plan coverage.
Upon checking kasi Frances, dun sa number mo na meron kang transactions na nag exceed na sa plan mo tulad ng mga sumusunod:
-voice call: 46.43
-SMS: 4.45+ 3.56 + 8.01
-internet data: 
-Share a load transaction: 46.00 
then lahat yan is subject for vat.
Then sa nagbabayad ka kasi in advance. But since yung first bill period mo is hindi kumpletong 30 days, automatic itong prorated kaya yun yung lumalabas na 99.90. Then yung binayad mo noon na dun na siya papasok sa next bill period.
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

I didn't noticed that I've overused the cellular data that's why i'm being charged way over my supposed bill. Can this please be my Christmas gift? I've been a loyal Globe user since I was in elementary school and I've been using postpaid since high school. now, i'm 21
Aww. Sorry to hear that. But it is considered as valid charge. 
So sorry about that. Did you forgot to monitor your data usage? 
i think so.
I can't do anything about it, since it's a valid charge. 
Aside from that, would there be anything else I can help you with?
Do you have any discounts? or promos? that would help me lessen my bill?
We have. Do you have rewards points?
i think so?
You can check it on your end, by dialing or text BAL send to 
i have a total of points
That points can be use as bill rebate. To lessen your bill. 
yeah but they're gonna use the rebate for january not for november december
Ahh, yes. 
I got no response from you. Would you still need my help?

Madami ako tanong dun. Like unfair Roaming charges.
Your bill for billing cycle isn't yet available for viewing.
Oct to nov po
Walang nasend sa mail ko
Wait, resend ko.
Okay na. Paki wait nalang within an hour.
Got it.
Mukang may spotify charge pa rin ako ah. July pa lang pinacancel ko na yun and recently i already had emails with your customer service following it up. Anyare po? :(
And ang laki ng data charges ko. 5.6k?? :O alam ko nagroaming ako pero diba may cap or protection yun? lang dapat diba?
Checking... 
 nalang Outstanding Balance mo, Lex.
:O
And ang next bill ko will be this december na? :O
Yup!
:O
Why oh why? 
I was expecting the roaming charges of at least i used last nov26-27. Siguro sa december bill na yun lalabas :o
Kelan ka ba umalis ng bansa?
Nov 24-27
Kung Nov 24-27 pa, dapat reflected na yun sa bill 48 (27 Oct 16 -26 Nov 16) mo.
:O 
So yun yung 5.6k nga? :o
Total bill mo yan for at 
Yung due date ng is 
Hindi nabayaran, kaya nung nagenerate yung bill nadoble na.

Okay na?
So far, oo. Antayin ko yung next bill :O

Ano mam gnyan b service nyo
Good morning! As checked, meron kang free Spotify Premium for 3 months and free Netflix Basic access for 6 months.
To activate your free Spotify Premium, please visit the link and enter your 11-digit number.
For Netflix Basic:
1. Customer clicks the link to the Globe-Netflix portal: 
2. Customer enters his mobile number then receives a one-time password (OTP) via SMS which he inputs in the portal page.
3. Once verified, customer is redirected to the Netflix portal (www.netflix.com) to complete the registration. 
4. Customer enters his email address and preferred password.
5. Customer successfully gets access to Netflix.
Yung Spotify Premium mo may 1GB data allocation, tapos yung sa Netflix naman free access, sa data allowance mo pa din sya mababawas.
I got no response from you. If you need my help, I'm just here.

By the way, the plan that Im subscribed on the Globe mylifestyle plan does include a 3Gb data plan on it right?
No, you are subscribed to GoSurf 99 with Free Spotify Basic.

You're right just checked on my recent bill. But I am confused on how to understand my bill. Let me give you a screenshot of this.
On my Globe bill on november I have a mylifetsyle plan period of to 
And there is another plan ""built-in unli call and text to dated to These two items really seems confusing. Please help me understand and consolidate what does it mean. Thank you
Okay! I'll explain it. 
You didn't charge of Built-in Unli Call and Text to Globe/TM from 10/27/16 to 11/26/16 amount of Because as you can see it's credited it has a sign letter C it means that's credited. 
It's already included to myLifestyle Plan 11/27/16-12/26/16 amount of 
So you didn't pay for it.
So meaning the mylifestyle plan includes unlicall to tm/globe and gosurf99?
Yes. It's included in your myLifestyle Plan 
Thanks for the explanation. Im planning to upgrade the data plan, from the current gosurf99 to what shall I do with my current account if im still currently subscribed to mylifestyleplan 
Hello
Yes, you can upgrade your GoSurf but it will be charge on top in your monthly bill.

I actually do have another concern
I changed my boosters and combos twice last nov and december days before my cutoff date which is every 23rd
But the new combos didnt reflect
Wasnt able to capture the ref #
Unless i can see the history of requests?
Pls advise. Thanka
May I know what are the boosters that you changed?
This is my current combo
Changing it to this:
In fact i just sent another request
Upon checking, here's your plan inclusions: 
- BEST EVER MYSUPERPLAN 
- Spotify Premium 
- Combo GOSURF 5GB (30 Days) with FREE SPOTIFY 1GB
- Combo All Globe Calls (20 mins) - Combo All Globe Calls (20 mins)
- Combo All Globe Calls (20 mins)
- Combo All Net (5 Mins and SMS)
- Combo All Net (5 Mins and SMS)
- Combo All Net Texts SMS) 
Is this correct? 
1 more combo all globe calls 
And yes thats the current
That i was trying to change since November
So, you have 4x Combo All Globe Calls (20 mins)? Not just 3x?
Were u able to see the screenshot i sent?
Its kinda long if i copy it here
Basically
3 - Combo All Globe Calls (20 mins)
2 - Combo All Net (5 Mins and SMS)
1 - Combo All Net Texts SMS)
And gosurf 
Yep, I'm just 	reassure so, less mistakes. 
Thanks! Your plan inclusions are already updated based on your request. 
Would there be anything else?
You mean effective already?
Yes dear. That is based on my system. 
May I know why my prev requests didnt take effect?
Hmm i still see the same inclusions on desktop pc and in my GServices app:
If u dont mind
May I know the current combos u have in ur system now pls?
Sorry, we're having system downtime in GServices. If it doesn't work, you can check through or visit My Account in Globe website. 
Don't worry! It's more updated in my system.
Ic ok. Thanks again Gir

Good afternoon Gie. Itatanong ko lang kung gaano ka-reliable yung checking ng data usage sa Yung total data used na yun less yung freebies tama? 
Nag-youtube kasi ako kagabi pero lumalabas sa balance check na 5mb lang halos nagamit ko. May delay ba minsan yung service n'yong yun? Ayaw ko lang lumampas sa data limit ko xD
Meron kabang data manager application?
Hello! Still there? If you need anything I'm just here waiting for your response.
Meron po.
Minsan kasi may system downtime sa services. Yeah right, yung total data used mo is male-less sa data allocation ng freebies mo. 
You can check sa data manager yung data, WiFi and roaming usages. Even yung calls and texts mo mamo-monitor mo dun kung ilan na alang yung natitira.

Just want to ask if ever my s7edge have crack on glass issued last May a postpaid plan, is there any charges if i will repair to samsung service center
Warranty does not cover cracked on glass. Charges may apply. 
Even I have warranty card?
While I cannot guarantee that it can be fixed or replaced, as physical damage is no longer part of the manufacturer warranty of the device, I suggest that you visit Samsung or any authorized Samsung re-seller to have your phone checked. 
I understand, but I asked someone working at globe and suggested me to show my warranty card whenever I will visit samsung service center for repair
That warranty card covered for 12 months regardless if it is user error or system error
Try to present that to Samsung store, but again, I cannot guarantee that it can be fixed or replaced for free because they're the one who'll check your mobile handset.

Hello gie i have a question base on my calculation i still have Php left to my plan is it consumable? Please advise
Thank you for your message.
Hmm... Let me check your plan details for you.
Okay
Right now, the only way you may track your remaining consumable amount is by monitoring your unbilled charges by dialing choose MyAccount then Unbilled Charges. 
Computation will be like this: Consumable amount minus Unbilled Charges (except for VAS And Share-A-Load) equals your remaining Consumable Balance.
I font understanf this
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
Okay2x
Good Afternoon. Mag-ask lang sana ako about sa payment ko monthly which is per month. The question is nagbayad po ako kanina then my bill payment is which yan yung outstanding balance ko. Necessary talaga na babayaran ko siya even though hindi ko siya nagamit? Kasi nag-try ako na i-register yun pero hindi naregister kasi akala ko pwede kasi nga sabi nung employee niyo na pwede ko iregister yung outstanding balance ko.
Kasi if ganyan yung policy I would rather to add na lang siya sa lifestyle plan which hindi ganyan kalaki ang outstanding balance ipa-convert ko siya again for 1.5 GB internet so yung magiging internet usage ko would be 4.5 GB instead of 3GB.

Need ko kaai makit ang bill bago ko pay ang need i-pay. Tsaka kung hndi pa naman due date, bkit need idisconnect ng buo?
As in lahat ng service, disconnected.
Possible kayang hndi na ko magpareconnect ulit then i'll pay the bill and the termination fee afterwards..
Kasi lumagpas ka na spending limit mo kaya ka na-disconnect. Possible naman na di ka na mag pa-reconnect tapos wait for the bill and settle it and then pay the termination fee.

Hi gie. Can i ask you something about my account?
Sure! What is it? 
How much is the maximum amount i will pay when i reach the 10gig of data
You will be charged P2 per MB once you've used up all your 10GB. Then your spending limit would be 
 pesos?
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
My current unbilled charges is amounting to for the internet fee.
Oops. Sorry my bad, I must've overlooked on your account. Your spending limit is pesos. Once you reached that amount, your line will be temporarily barred.
I got more xonfused with that
Which part Jen? Allow me to help you further. 
You have already used up all your 10GB of data so now you're being charged 2 pesos per MB. That's why your are charge with that amount on data. 
Di ba there is a certain amount na when i reach the charging stops.
Yup. That's the spending limit. Once you reached more than your line will automatically be barred. 
Barred? As in pati calls and texts?
Pero iba ang explanation sa kin
I know that there is certain limit. Pero yung sa internet ang tinatanong ko.
Yup, calls and texts. Pano ba yung inexplain sayo?
Yup. Yung spending limit works on calls, texts, data, share a load transactions.
Before kasi di ba sa globe if you reach for example 10 gig babagal lang ang internet mo. Parang magigubg 2g
Pero ngayon kasi nagchacharge na kayo ng amount at the same speed di ba
So inexplain sa kin na for example nareach ko ang hindi na magchachatge for internet
I see. Yung sa Fair use policy yata yung tinutukoy mo. Pero hindi kasi siya applicable sa GoSurf promo. Then yung sa binanggit mo na yun naman is yung for anti bill shock.
Yung anti shock nga
Yung anti bill shock kasi is valid sa data charges. Let's say na naka GoSurf na 10Gb ka, pasok siya under anti bill shock na may bracket limit na So incase na lumagpas ka more than na bayarin, fix na 3.5k nalang yung babayaran mo.
Yah. data ko 10 gig
Okay lang ba Jen na ituloy nalang natin yung conversation bukas? Kasi I have to go na. 
Ok
Thanks
Basta i-message mo nalang ako, babalikan agad kita. Eexplain ko sayo lahat bukas. Pasensya ka na. 
Thank you and have a nice day Jen!

Okay, I will change it for you, but is it okay that the effective date is on January 17th? just to avoid double charging.
So just to be clear this changes that you'll do has no additional charges?
???
There wouldn't be additional charges. However, I forgot to tell that this modification should be two days before the day of your cut off.
Thats OK you can modify it as soon as possible...
Sure. Just chat me two days before your cut off and I'd be here to assist you.
Ok noted

Good morning, Claire. 
Oh, I see. How may I help you today? 
How does the data rollover work? Am i automatically registered to that program when i applied for a plan?
Hello, Claire!
I see here that your GoSurf is not part of your plan. Therefore, GoSurf Rollover is not plan applicable for you.
What do you mean it's not part of my plan?
Since your account is under myBusiness flex plan, your surfing pack is business surf (3GB). However, you can migrate to a Business Surf with Rollover.
Hello? Still there?
I don't remember applying for myBusiness plan
Oops! My bad. Looking into your account details, yes your plan is not myBusiness Plan. It is Business Flex Plan.
Tell me more about Business Flex plan
Hmmm. I think I am not the best person to discuss about your plan. If you want you can call our hotline at (02) anytime you are available. I hope you'll understand.

What are the terms and conditions of my post paid plans?
Why is it that i can no longer use the internet?

Hi Good Morning!! im done with the spotify activation and logging in. what to i do next to get the free 3 months subscription. or what i already did was the right thing? i won't be charged with the Php 49 3 months offer right, as what spotify offers.
Yes you have nothing to worry about! It's FREE! You have 7 days try out period then after that you have to register again for 3 months free subscription.
okay noted thanks
Hi i would like to ask.. ive read just now in the brochure stating in my plan that it has spotify or hooq free 3 mos subscription
. I would like to choose hooq instead of the spotify. Can u check
?
Thank you for waiting upon checking your account,you already have FREE Spotify premium on your plan.
Ohh i see because you said i only have free spotify, well in the first place i supposedly have the option to choose between the two. Cant we revert the request.? Anyways, my spotify got activated just last night and i havent used it yet til now.
If you want to modify your account do it 2 days before your cut off period to avoid charges on top of your bill.
Okay when is my cut off by the way?
Your cut off date is every 26th of the month.

Hi sorry late, I sent this message earlier, maybe you didn't see. 
I'd also like to know if there's any way that my monthly bill can be reduced. I'm paying a fixed amount of for my handset and around more or less for my lifestyle plan. This is for a 24 month lock in period in which I'm at the 7th or 8th month. My desired monthly amount to pay would be in the range. Are there any options that I could take?

Thank you for choosing Globe as your network provider. Regarding your concern, you want to downgrade your plan am I right? Is that what you want, and for what reason?
Yes I would like to downgrade my plan for me to have a slightly lower monthly bill, preferably in the range of a month as I've been experience health issues lately, which prevent me from allotting my funds to pay my Globe bills on time.
ohh,sorry to hear that.
Regarding your concern, you want to downgrade your plan to but upon checking your account, you plan is only only!
A monthly bill within that range would be of great help for me. I understand that my current plan is locked into 24 months, but I hope that Globe would be able to give some consideration and options on how I can still fulfill my contract and at the same time, have financial flexibility.
May I know what is your plan now, with your Globe postpaid plan?
 lifestyle plan. I pay an additional for the handset fee.
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Yes! Spotify Premium has an auto renew function, where after the given time of FREE usage, it will automatically charged on top of your monthly bill.
What i mean is, i can still avail my free spotify premium for 3 months even if i purchased the 49 pesos for 3 months spotify premium?
Using the same Globe postpaid mobile number?
No, but im gonna use the same email address
You can. If you subscribed to that promo using your Globe postpaid plan mobile number, it will be charged on top of your bill.
I can use my free spotify premium anytime?

San po nanggaling 48.96 na yan?
Wala nman sya sa unbilled charges
Mam?
San po ung 48.9 na yan?

Because I don't know where the amount came from.. please see attached pictures
I don't know where the PHP came from
Ang bill mo ay PHP ni-less ang advance payment mo na PHP kaya naging PHP 
But the promo the I got is the monthly bill for 2 years..
 less 
Where did the PHP come from? I get the 6.70 PHP due to a call from a different network.. it can't be through text because it unli text to all networks..
You have Globe Passthrough of plus the VAT. 
Could you tell me what globe passthrough is?
Passthrough is share-a-load transaction. 
But I never did a share a load transaction..
It hasn't been a month of having this globe postpaid and I'm already having so much problems.
Tsk tsk.
Well, this is a no holding plan so I could have this cut anytime...
As check to your account, you have share-a-load transaction last Don't worry, this is not yet final, let's just wait for your bill to be generated to validate the charges. 
Maybe someone used your phone and made the transaction.
no i doubt that happened... and i applied just december 11 or 12... and since i bring my phone where ever I go. and my family members are smart except my dad which he has a line in globe..
Let's just for your bill to be generated to validate the charges. 
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Nag-try ka ba dati na gumawa ng Spotify account? Now, are you using your postpaid mobile number sa pagre-register?
Oo
oo
nung magsign up ulit ak ang nakalagay alread register na daw yung email
Yung e-mail na ginamit mo sa iyong first account ay ang e-mail na ginamit mo din nung nag-register ka ulit?
yung email na ginamit ko is yung nakaregister sa globe nung kinuha itong phone.
ginamit ko sya para makapagsign up sa spotify.
sa spotify ko palang gagamitin ang email na to. bale isang beses palang
nung sinabi mong mag sign up ak sa spotify dun ko sya ginamit
Try mo i-visit yung dati mong account sa Spotify, then, chnage the registered number into your postpaid mobile number.
Saan dun?
Check your profile then, edit it. Pwede mo yun i-explore.

How about im using mobile hotspot? Will i get charge for that?
If you will connect to others internet connection by hotspot it will not consume your data allocation. However, if you will be the one who's sharing your data allocation by doing hotspot then it will deduct to your data allocation. 
Ok thank you for that. Coz im sharing my date yesterday. How much will it cost?
Is it okay if i will not turn off my data coz im the one who used it? Will i get charge as welk for not turning it off?
It will just deduct to your data allocation and if you consumed your 3GB you will be charged P2.00/MB. 
It's okay, but I suggest to just turn it off when you're not using it so unexpected consuming of your data will not happen. 
Ok thank you.
It is my pleasure to help. Anything else I can help you with today?

Ok thanks Gie
Also, I have a new contract effective bec I got the new iPhone 7
Supposedly with addtl deposit, which is the advance, to be credited at the end of the contract
You're welcome! 
What is it? 
But i also paid addtl in advance when I got my current plan 2 yrs ago, which is supposed to be credited at the end of this contract
So shouldn't my Dec bill be less 
I see. Actually, the you paid in advance is for the current period that time. Since consumers are paying first before availing the service. 
I was told it is a ""deposit"" when I got the iphone 6 plan, which will be credited back to me at the end of the contract. Since is the end of the iphone 6 contract, shouldn't the be credited to me?
Same as when I got the iphone 5, i paid in advance and it was credited to me at the end of that contract
Your credit will reflect at the end of your contract on January next year.

Good morning

I can't go yet to the nearest globe store coz it's a 1hr travel and have a child to babysit.
To state all my concerns
By the way i just found it out lately about my phone
I thought it was a 32G phone coz when i applied i will be sent a 32G ultra XA Sony experia phone
Then when my husband had a Christmas break he found out that the phone i got is only 16G
And my another concern is can i have this number change and replace it with a NEW one coz really unknown numbers are texting
This time everyday different numbers some even call
I feel paranoid and unsecured
Your number may have once been in use in the past, but once an account has been terminated, the mobile number is kept inactive in our system for a certain period (6 mos minimum).
Any concerns related to the previous owner remain with the old account. Once the inactive period has ended, the number is issued to you as a fresh account with no history.
If you want to change your number, you have to pay for the service modification fee and for the easy or preferred number.
And also why i wasnt given a 32G phone instead u gave me 16G
Ill be paying more than 6k just to change my number thats incredible
Okay, let me check your account first, Jho. Kindly wait.
And also, the assigning of numbers is system generated, that's why.

May i ask kng paano ko malalaman na lampas na ako sa free net na gnagamit ko for a month
Pwede mo sya i-check sa GServices and My Account via Globe website. 
Hindi ko xa macheck.pwd pki inform ako kng na consume ko na
As checked may remaining data allocation ka pa. 
Kng purely fb lng ba gamit ko maconsume ko pa ba yan for 1 month o hindi na?
Wla ba kayong go signal kng naubos ko na ang free net ko?
Hindi pla fix yong na babYaran ko per month?
When will be my first payment?
Sorry, may remaining ka pa na sa data allocation mo. 
Text SURFALERT ON to for free.
Para saan ang surf alert?
Ang SurfAlert ay your browsing will be put on hold and you'll receive free alerts and flash notifications when your mobile phone or device tries to connect to the internet at kapag na consumed mo na yung data allocation. 
As checked, hindi pa generated yung bill mo. 
What do u mean na hindi pa generated ang bill ko?sorry f marami akong tanong first time ko kc magplan
Okay lang. Ibig sabihin hindi pa nagagawa or finalize yung bill mo at yung amount na babayaran mo. Tanong ka lang para ma familiarize mo yung sarili mo sa Postpaid plan mo. 
Akala ko kc fix yong na babayaran ko.ano ba ang breakdown ng na payments ko na 
Sa ba kasali na yong phone at load sa binabayaran ko?
Yes, kasama na! Mag e-exceed ka lang naman if mag te-texts and calls ka sa other networks and pag nag exceed ka sa data mo and pag nag share-a-load ka and VAS subscription mo.

Jerwin R. Soriano
Thanks for reaching out! Before we start, I just have a few questions
May I please have your mobile number?
Thanks for the info, Jerwin Soriano! Just to confirm, did I get your full name right?
Yes
Got it! One last question, may I confirm if the mobile number is under your name?
Yes
May I confirm if these are correct? :) : name - Jerwin Soriano, phone - the account is under your name - Yes. Please confirm
Yes
Thanks, Let me check my records first, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Gemmalyn Soriano is my mother
Okay, how may I help you today, Jerwin?
i did not understand the free fb.
Your free Facebook is just free access to Facebook. If you upload, download or post something on Facebook, it will still eat up your data allowance. 
but if i just check my notification, scan through my newsfeed and check my messages will i be charged for that?
It won't eat up your data if you just browse it. But make sure that you're using the free mode.
ok thank you
when does my plan refreshes?
It will refresh every 6th day of the month.
if i still have unused data, can i carry it over the next month?
It's possible if you have GoSurf with Rollover. But as checked, you do not have GoSurf with Rollover.
how will i have that?
I can enroll you with that.
Anyway, I'm done for today! Just message me anytime and I'll get back to you soonest. You can reach me from 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM daily. Enjoy the rest of the day!

ask ko lang bat di ko narereceive yung billing statement ko sa email? kung hinde pa ako nagrereact hinde pa magpapadala ng SOA
I'm Gie of Globe
I'm here to help you with your Globe Postpaid plan :-)
ask ko din bakit advance billing sa billing period 12/05/16 up to 12/12/16... at 12/13/16 up to 01/12/17
Thank you for your message. 
Before we proceed, pwede bang malaman ang iyong buong pangalan at postpaid mobile number?
Arvin Tino
Salamat sa impormasyon. 
Kaya ganyan ang bill cycle mo kasi yung 12/05 ay ang iyong date ng activation ng account mo, ang 12/12 naman ay ang iyong cut-off date.
Kaya ang cover ng first bill mo ay form 12/05 to 12/12.
Ang next bill mo naman ay makakabuo na ng isang whole bill cycle na from 12/13 to 01/12.
Kaya hindi whole bill cycle ang una mong bill kasi system generated ang cut-off date. 
bakit kasama na rin yung 12/13/16 up to 12/12/17? sa ibang bill?
Unang bill two period?
Please do clear yung part na 12/13/16 up to 12/12/17. Isang buong taon?
sorry up to 1/12/17
Tungkol naman sa delayed bill mo. Sorry for the inconvenience. Pwede mo na ma-view ang iyong bill via MyAccount and will be delivered in a few days.
Rest assured na ang iyong due date ay na-adjust and your next bill's due date will back to normal schedule.
No, magkaibang billing period yan. Yung una pro-rated, yung second bill ay one whole bill cycle. 
magkasama po sa 1st Bill ko
Okay, check ko muna tapos babalikan kita. 
ok po
Kaya dalawa yan, yung una is pro-rated, yung pangalawa is for your advance payment.
Okay! 
Feel free to chat pag may kailangan ka. Enjoy the rest of the day!

Tired of calling you guys thru your hotline.
Is it regarding the waiver of your charges for the bill period of 16 Oct to 15 Nov?
Yes.
Your case was not granted due to insufficient details provided by the handler.
What do you mean?
Your request regarding your charges were not able to be granted. A certain amount was supposed to be waived, but since the information was insufficient, the case was closed and was not granted.
Can you reopen the case and check my previous bill instead?
It's clear and it's showing in my billing statement that Globe double charge me for and I also have Voice charges which I do have consumable for voice calls
Sure! Please wait while I analyze your account.

You will process a request or it's already processed?
I'll be getting a reference no./ Right?
Just in case.
I don't want to follow up on this again.
I'm getting tired of talking to different analyst and explaining the situation over an over
and yet I'm not getting any resolution from you guys
Don't worry, I've already processed it and it's already deducted on your account. 
I understand how you feel as a customer that's why I already processed it immediately. 
Thank you so much for your quick response on this.
The agent that handled your request last time might not informed you that you are going to be charged if you change it under the same billing period.
May I know what's my ticket no.?
or reference no.?
You're welcome Anne! Unfortunately, there's no ticket or reference number for this. But you can check your current balance for updates that have been made.

Ma.cecile balbuena 
Thanks for the info. By the way, how do you want me to call you?
This number may have once been in use in the past, but once an account has been terminated, the mobile number is kept inactive in our system for a certain period (6 mos minimum). Any concerns related to the previous owner remain with the old account. Once the inactive period has ended, the number is issued to you as a fresh account with no history.
Ah ok just call me cecile
Is there anything else I can help you with, Cecile?
Pls help me if how would i know that my monthly plan was overuse na or exceed to the limit already
Once you've already exceeded your spending limit, your line will be barred.

GoSurf 10GB data allocation is worth You can upgrade your data allocation from 6GB to 10GB but it will be charged on top of your monthly bill. Also, to avoid multiple charges on your bill. I suggest to do it day after your bill cut-off.

hi. how do we start?
hw do i redeem reward pts
are you a real person or m i talking to a robot?
I'm a real person. 
First, welcome to Globe Family. I'm Gie of Globe and I'll be here to assist you with your Globe Postpaid plan. 
Before I process your question, may I know your full name and Globe postpaid number, please? 
I'm annie atienza. this is my dad's postpaid account. he let's me transact for him since he is a senior citizen. my pin to transact for this account is as listed in your records.
account name: dominador s. atienza
postpaid number: 
he's planning to downgrade his postpaid to PLAN (without gadget).
Hi, since your dad's plan is BEST EVER MYSUPERPLAN it is not allowed to downgrade if you want you can upgrade to myLifestyle No lock up plan 
he wants the basic one with free text and calls to globe. which plan is it?
1. how do I avail of the rewards points?
2. how do I enroll this account to a downgraded plan? 
if i apply for lifestyle plan (without gadget) how much will i pay monthly less rebates?
The basic plan of myLifestyle plan is you will have 
a. Unlimited calls to Globe/TM and unlimited texts to all networks (valued at 
b. Free Facebook for 24 months
c. Free Spotify* or HOOQ for 3 months
d. Free 1GB Globe Cloud for 24 months
e. 
e. Consumable of that can be use to call or text other network. You can also use that to browse the internet, regular rate will apply. 
You will pay depends on the usage of your plan. Plan + charges on top of your bill = monthly payment. 
how much is the rebate considering it doesn't include a new gadget?
Okay, here would be the easiest way to change plan. You need to finish your current plan which is Best Ever My Super Plan since the end date is on January 27, 
Then avail a New Plan which is under myLifestyle Plan. 
This is reconsidered as re-contracting. 
ah. ok. so how do i get the pts reward?
Did you receive a text message about that?
yes. i got this text which lead to our chat conversatiom. --- Hi! Gie of Globe here. Thank you for spending another year with us. To celebrate this milestone, we're giving you bonus Rewards points as a gift! To claim, go to and send me a message on Facebook Messenger. Chat with you soon!
i talked to a cs rep last month re recontracting. i was told i could already apply for a new plan come dec 27 since this plan expires on jan 27, i inquired abt what my dad wanted (unli txt call to globe and no new gadget). cs said i could avail a lower plan no lock up and since there's no new gadget i could get a rebate off my bill, something like I'd pay only a month considering i don't exceed my limit on the plan. is this right?
Alright! 
Youג€™ll receive your bonus Rewards Points within 3-5 working days. By the way, Iג€™m always here if you have any questions on your Globe Postpaid plan.
thank you gie. it's actually more convinient than waiting on the phone for 45 mins on hold to talk to a csr 
is gie your real name or is it short for Globe?
I see but about your concern you can call our loyalty hotline (02) for the proper handling for that. 
Operating hours would be 8am ג€“ 10pm.
Yes, my real name is Gie. 
Thank you for appreciating, may I ask if I can call you Annie or you have a preferred nickname that you want me to address you? 
u can call me annie
can i apply for a new plan online/via hotline or should i go to a globe center?
Okay, Annie. The first step, you should call the loyalty then they will tell you what do you need to do. 
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Hi good morning..
Hi! :)
Ask ko lang po kung bakit ganun ang bill ko..
Ibig sabihin po ba naubos ko kaagad ung last payment ko dated Dec. 6, Thank you
What happened to the free 3gb data?
Dahil ang 1st bill mo ay prorated, meaning you will be billed on the time your account was activated until the bill cut-off date and not for the whole month. 
And ang advance payment mo is mag ta-take effect sa last billing period ng contract mo. 
Cge po.. thanks..
It is my pleasure to help. May iba ka pa bang concern?

Thanks for reaching out! Before we start, I just have a few questions
May I please have your mobile number?

Let me check...
I see that you want to check if payment received or reflected, I'm still learning, Let me see if I can connect you with one of our experts...
no
thats not what i mean
last monday, i inquired for my total consumed data. it said today. i inquired again for my total consumed data. but it said 37MB. why did it rollback to a lesser data usage?
is there something wrong with your system?
then when i inquired from Globe Telecom thru messenger with the same query, they said the number is not under my name. when its what Globe gave me as an account.
Are you the account holder?
yes
i paid the plan under my own card and name
Sorry but the Postpaid number that you gave did not matched. It is not under your name. Kindly double check the number. 
how can that be possible?
Rol from globe assisted me upon getting an account and gave me that number
so what are you trying to say? someone else is holding the said number while im using the sim card with that number?
THATS MY NUMBER

Can you please check if I am being deducted for using Spotify premium? I'm sure my current plan includes Spotify premium but i received a message from Spotify informing me that i have been deducted for my premium subscription.
As checked, you have free Spotify in your GOSurf and you also have another subscription to Spotify 
How do I fix that? Before I signed up for the Spotify I couldn't access Spotify Premium. Even wasn't working. So as it is, I'm paying for something that should've been free correct?
Yup. Since you register to it. You can opt it out by texting STOP to 
Sorry, we cannot process your Spotify request at this time. Please try again later
Is the reply.
If I opt out from will I still have the monthly payment? Also, will I still be able to use Spotify premium?
You can use the Premium now. But the Spotify Standalone is already charged.
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
It's ok. Next week would be great. Enjoy the holidays. Happy new year
One more thing though, can you cut off my Spotify that charges monthly so that I'm left with the one that comes with my plan? Just so it doesn't charge me for another month.
Happy New Year to you and your family. 
If you already successfully opt it out, it will be removed in your plan permanently. 
Ok, I'll just try again some time later or tomorrow. Thanks again Gie.
Okay. Just message me again if you need my help. Enjoy the rest of the day! 
Will do Gie. Thank you.

Oh, OK. You have 5 GB data under your plan and unli call and text to Globe/TM.
You also have worth of consumable.
Great, thanks!
Will the consumable carry over to the next month if I don't use it?
No, it won't be carried over.
What do you suggest I use it for then?
Try calling other network or texting them since it's not included in your plan.
Hahaha okay
Apps?
Using online apps will still be deducted to your GoSurf. If ever you consume your GoSurf, that's when you can use your consumable.
Right
How about subscriptions?
It will be charged on top of your plan since consumables can only be use to call text and data.

what is the normal schedule for my bill due date ?
Sorry for the confusion.
Your bill is not yet generated as checked again.
when will my first bill be generated then?
You will receive your bill next month and you will be notified once your bill is already sent to you.
ok. thanks
Just add 21 days to your cut-off date and that will be your due date.
Anything else?
when is my cut-off date?
For that, please provide the following details for security purposes.
1.Plan.
2.Registered Email Address.
3.Activation Date.
1.myLifestyle Plan 
3.December 
Thanks.
Your cut-off date is every 12th day of the month.
Anything else?
if so , my due date will be when?
Probably first week of February.
thank you. got no more question for today ;) thanks again.
You are welcome and have a great day!
Hazel Joy S Feliciano
Please help.
1st bill will be prorated. Meaning you will be billed based on the time your account was activated until the bill cut-off date and not for the whole month. 
And your advance payment will take effect on the last month of your contract. 
And as checked, your bill is not yet generated so your bill is not yet final.

Hi. I was wondering. How did I consume about 2GB if I only use spotify and clash of clans and youtube from time to time. I thought spotify consumes data around kb per second and the same with clash of clans. I usually used our wifi for download.
I also used google.com but not all the time.
Is there a way to monitor the data usage?
You can check your bill, data usage, subscription and a lots of stuffs through the following:1. Download G services app. in play store.2. Visit My Account in Globe website.3.ֲ Dial 
Pano ko malalaman ung free internet s plan ko kung tapos n o lampas n? Pwede b tawagan mo n lang ako...
May ma rereceive ka naman na SMS notification regarding to this. O kaya naman, i - download mo ang my data manager app.

Can i pay at the Globe center at Nccc Mall
How come i exceeded with 
Hi! Your total unbilled charges on top of your monthly recurring fee (MRF) is PHP23.15. Breakdown as follows: Local Call=PHP0.00; call to other network=PHP0.00; IDD call=PHP0.00; local SMS=PHP23.15; intl SMS=PHP0.00; Internet=PHP0.00; Ringback Tone=PHP0.00 and ShareALoad=PHP0.00. This amount may not yet reflect charges from the last 2 hours and doesn't include amount of value-added services and promos. Your plan's allocation and freebies will be consumed first before you are charged with the applicable rate for call, text and mobile internet.
I got that from 
That's your total amount due with VAT. 
Yep, you can pay through Globe stores.
As checked, you have Text to other network transaction that's why you have Php 23.15 unbilled charges.

How may I help you today, Ampy?
I just want to clear if how could I monitor my monthly internet that I may not be charged for the exceed usage. That's all thanks
You can monitor your data usage through or G-services app which is downloadable in Playstore.
You can also log in to Globe website and select MyAccount or set up a data mobile manager via phone settings (set it to your desired data limit).
So my internet allocation per month is that so?
So if I exceed that's the time I'll be charged?correct me if I'm mistaken pls
Yes, and that would be 2/ MB.
If I exceed to 2mb?? Is equivalent to 6Gb?
Thank u
That would be P 2.00 / MB. No, it's 7 GB. The 1 GB data allocation is for the Spotify.
Thank u very much .... I hope I can ask questions again
Sure, anytime and anywhere.

Kapag mag-a-avail ng Loyalty offer, you need to call between 8PM - 10PM.
Nyek
Ikaw ba yung lagi ko kausap?
Db po un ang concern ko pakiback read naman ng usapan natin
Oo ako lang. Nalito na ko. Wait lang 
Tagal natin uusap db nga po yung commitment sa akin?
Pasensya na. Marami din akong commitments sa iba #hugot
Wait confirm ko lang... san ka nagpa-reactivate ng account?
Moa grr
Kala ko nmn ok na
Kino-confirm ko nga lang. Galit ka naman agad. 
Tama yung info na sabi nila which is yung account still in contract. Ang ginawa kasi is ni-reactivate yung previously cancelled account, then continued lang yung existing contract mo before.
Pero you can still avail naman an iPhone 7 via Loyalty offer. May possible pre-term lang. Wait, I'll try to compute muna.
Sabi yung cash out sama sa bill un sabi
Baka nmn iba nnmn
Cashout para sa handset? Iba yun sa possible pre-term fee, ha?
Ung preterm db yung termination fee?
Yes and yun yung kailangan bayaran outright. Yung possible na ma-charge to your bill is yung handset cashout which is for approval pa din.
Ang concern ko po db po nagusap tayo iofferan ako noon ng dec 19 around 12nn ng iphone7 sabi una wala daw ako babayaran pag recontract tapos cashout isasamaa sa bill
Bigla s huli hindi daw pinaasa kmi
Un ang concern ko pakicheck mga notify since dec 19
Sabi ng Globe loyalty tatawag sila isang araw pa hangang ngaun wala pa din
Yung info na binigay ko, yun din yung tini-tignan ko sa notes nung 12/19, which is yung day after na nagpa-reactivate ka sa branch namin sa MOA.
Pinasa nila ako sa Globe loyalty
Kasi po nagrereklamo ako about sa ginawa nilang free contract na dapat contrata habang nagrereklamo po ako bigla ako pinasa sa Globe Loyalty kaya ako nagka idea sa nga iphone 7 siya nagsabi sa akin
Yung supervisor sabi tTwagan ako about jan hangang ngaun wala pa din eh
Dec 19 12nn my nakausap ako globe loyalty iofferan ako
Dec 19 mga around 9pm tumawag ako san loyalty again para itanong ang authorization letter then after nun nagtanong siya sabi ko un lang po then nagtanong siya sabi niya "" meron pa ba kayo gusto itanonnf?"" Then sabi ko nagtanong na lang ako about sa transfer name un lang... pero ang ninotify niya lang nagtanong ako about transfer account na ang tanong ko talaga about sa plan iphone7
Dec 22 tumawag ulit ako sabi walang ganun nag offer doon ko nilalaban yung sinabi mga nakaraan nakausap ko ng dec 19
Tapos pinapubta na ako sa moa defend naman sila
TPos tumawag na loyalty supervisor sabi aayusin niya lahat tTwag siya ngaun wala pa rin... malamang sasabihan lang sa akin ""Sorry"
Tapos banda huli malabo pa
Sana hindi na lang nag bangit or offer ng kung ano ano para hindi umasa yung tao
Kunh tutuusin dapat hindi na kami mahirapan sa request namin dami na nasayang oras.. doon pa lang sa pagbigay ng number na dapat luma binigay nila bago number .. ang perwesyo doon mam yung natext blast ko yung old number sa lahat ng contact ko at nilagay ko sa application for Australia namin na ang lumabas bagong number
Tapos yung contrata ginawang free contract na dapat hindi. nilagay lang note lang na contrata kami.. sabi po ng ISP hindi daw pwede yung ganun..
Iniba yung number tapos nun gusto namin ipabalik need pa mag bayad ng para mabalik old number... kung hindi pa kami magrereklamo hindi nila ibibigay yung old number namin na walang bayad.
Baka yan sapat na yan sa mga hiling namin...
Mahirap contakin ang kuya ko mam dahil sobrang Bz niya sa Singapore..
Paki read na lang po yan.. nakailang beses nanako ikwento lahat yan sa ibat ibang agent ng Globe
Yung about sa Loyalty muna. Hindi naman sa ganun. Nag-note din naman sila nung tumawag ka regarding sa requirements na authorization letter and IDs, pati yung advise regarding Transfer of Ownership nung account. Pero walang specifics regarding sa offer.
Dec 19 9pm po yan
Dec 19 12nn yan yung unang una kong nakausap sa Globe loyalty
About naman dun sa number, if within 6 months kayo nagreactive from the time na na-disconnect yung account, pwede pa ma-retrieve yung old number. Otherwise, ma-aassign na siya sa iba.
Hindi po ung dec 19 9pm
Un nga po mam alam ko po un pero ang sabi sa amin mum nagbigay ng Sim card old number na mismo ung binigay niya
Tapos nun nalaman namin hindi pala sinisingil kami 
Wait.. ako muna para hindi tayo magkalituhan 
Ok po
Yung regarding sa free contract and ISP medyo hindi ko na-gets. Pero ganito kasi, yung last bill mo --- included yung unpaid balance + pre-term fee. 
 lang binayaran ko kasi ngaun continue namin
Pagbinayran ko yung 13k na un total wala na contract
Kasi hindi eh
Ang pinabayaran lang sayo is kasi we waived the pre-term fee since you only need to continue what was left noon.
Un po
Yep, korek! Pero pwede ka pa rin nga mag-avail ng iPhone 7 via Loyalty. Yun yung time na babayaran mo na yung pre-term (outright) + cash-out na pwede din ma-charge to your bill once approved.
Un po kasi baka mamaya hindi nanamn papayag na hindi kasama yung cashout sa bill
Babayaran ko yung outright
Yun ba yung previous na inoffer sayo? 
Basta isama nila sa bill cashout un sabi sa akin dec 19 around 12nn
Opo
Basta offer sa akin dec 19 aroung 12nn from CustomerCare pinasa ako sa Loyalty 
Ang una kong tanonf meron ba ako babayaran jan sa sinabi mong iphone kung wala wag na lang sabi niya wala kahit cashout ipapasok sa bill ... tanong ko termination fee need pa bayaran kasi kung need wag na lang ibalik ninyo yung hinilibg ko na contrta ginawang free contract sabi sa sakin wala parin unulit ko un nagmamadali siya basta need niya kang authorization.. then claim ko daw iphone 7 nagcompute pa siya plus (iiphone 7) = monthly ko
I see. If yung iPhone 7 walang cashout under sa plan na preferred mo, pre-term lang bale since under contract ka pa until May 
Yep, pwede nga i-charge to bill yung cashout divided by 24 months. Ang babayaran mo nalang outright ay yung pre-term fee.
Opo okay na ako doon.. alam ninyo bakit? Kasi nun sinabi sa akin un mam benta ko phone ko po
Kailan po? At saan? At paano
Tapos kung pwede kasi mas mura un pag kasama cahsout 
Paano ko po maclaim?
San me magbayad 
Then kailan magstart billing po.
Iג€™m almost done for today! We can continue chatting tomorrow at 9:00 AM - 5:30 PM if you want? Just chat me in your most convenient time.ֲ 
Mam ano na nangyari?
Hindi ninyo nasagot po jan pa po kayo?
Mam 5:07pm pa lng po Jan kanpa po?
Ask ko lang Hanggang kelan kaba na authorize ng kuya mo to use his account?
Ito yung sabi
Kita ninyo po?
Ano update pi?
Po?
Yup na indicate ko na naman yan sa attachement mo .
Okau po
Okau po
Ano next po
Then I advise you na tumawgg ka sa ating loyalty team para sa iPhone7 mo para mas malinawan ka.
Ok po
OkAy ba po ba ? Cash out bill?
Cash out bill? You mean babayadan for this month ba? or sa recontracting mo?
Isasama sa bill 2onths
24months
Lalabas ko lng termination fee
Hindi pa okay?
Yep and you may pay to the nearest globe store na malapit sayo. 
Bali po okay na po? Yung cash out sasama sa billing ko monthly?
Termination fee lang babayaran ko sa globe store?
Last m yn po
Para malinaw po

How may I help you today?
hello ask ko lang sana if pwede pa ba ma upgrade ung unit na nakuha ko to iphone? tnx
Pwede naman, kaso mamimili ka sa dalawang options, either mag a-additional line ka ( pwede lang kung pasok pa sa credit limit mo).
Or ipapa-terminate mo yung current contract mo then mag a-avail ka ng new plan para makapag avail ka ng bagong handset.
pwede naman na mag add ng line
pano pala pag pina terminate ko may babayaran ba ako at if nakapag avail na ako ng bago same number parin ba?
Yes, magbabayad ka ng pre-termination fee. 
And new number na ang mapupunta sayo kasi system generated ang pag assign ng number eh.
Nandiyan ka pa ba? Nandito lang ako pag may kailangan ka, huwag mahiyang i-chat ako.
di ba pwede i-upgrade ung plan ko mag dadagdag ako ng so na siya instead of 
Ganito kasi yan, kung gusto mo mag upgrade ng plan pero hindi pasok sa credit limit mo, kailangan mo muna mag increase ng credit limit mo para ma-avail mo ang desired plan mo and handset.
And kailangan mo mag submit ng another proof of financial capacity para mag increase ang credit limit mo.
ah ok kasi ang salary ko naman is around 35K and un din nilagay ko dun sa form ko pasok ba un sa credit limit?
It depends kasi sa computation, Fransil eh.

Hello good morning! Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday. How may I help you today? Do you have any questions or concerns with your Globe postpaid plan? 
Allnet call & text ba ung kasama sa plan ko?
Bale unlimited calls and texts to Globe and TM lang. Then 6GB na allocated data for internet use.
Ah ok ang sabi kc sakin nung nagdeliver pinapili nya ako kng 3gb of data tpos the rest is pwede ko gmitin unli text to all network.
I see. Pwede naman mangyari yun kaso magiging 3GB nalang data mo and hindi na 6GB. 
Oo yun nga po ung pinili ko.3gb data nd allnet. Gsto ko lng mlaman if unli call & text un or unli text lang sa allnet.
I see. Bale unli text lang sa allnet. Para mabago natin yung plan inclusion mo, pwede ko ba malaman yung details mo for security purposes:
1. email address na naka register sa Globe account mo
2. Plan availed
Alright, thanks! But please take note na mag take effect to sa next billing period mo ha. Para maiwasan natin yung double charge.

May I please have your mobile number?
Thanks for the info, Jan Bert Lencioco! Just to confirm, did I get your full name right?
Yes
Got it! One last question, may I confirm if the mobile number is under your name?
Yes
May I confirm if these are correct? :) : name - Jan Bert Lencioco, phone - the account is under your name - Yes. Please confirm
Yes
Thanks, Let me check my records first, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Okay.
Welcome to Globe Family! I'll be here to assist you with your Globe Postpaid plan. How may I help you today?
Thanks. My problem ryt now is I can't use my internet due to signal in my area. Can u help me w/ this?
Yes, I can help you with that. Don't worry. 
First may I know how many signal bar do you have?
I only have 3 signal bars and its 2G. There's no 3G/4G signal here in my location. :(
May i know your exact location, please? 
Brgy. Calumpang Zone 6 Molo, Iloilo City.
I'll check it, Jan! 
Pls. Thank You.
Ops is it okay to call you, Jan? or you have a preferred nickname? 
Its okay to call me jan.
As checked, there is no outage. May I ask did you try to restart your phone? 
Kindly, turn off your mobile phone then remove the SIM and battery for 30 seconds, and then put them back in. Turn it on to refresh its network connections. 
Yhup many times.
Actually i have a signal but only 2G bcoz of my area. If Im at mall or something, its say 4G. I tried it w/ my other smartphones. The problem is theres no 3G in my location. Even my pocket wifi is in 2G connection.
Since this is being experienced indoors, the possible cause is penetration loss. 
The signal was not able to penetrate the structure you are in. We sincerely apologize for this, rest assured we value your feedback for the improvement of our services. 
Thank you for your patience and understanding. 
Yes. Even when Im outside of my house. There's 3G but only 1 bar signal and I tried to open my data and still can't refresh my notifications on fb even on messenger.
Okay thank you, hopefully soon you'll have 4G in our area. Bcoz my 6GB/month data is useless when I'm at home.
I understand what you will, don't worry I will coordinate this concern. 
Thank You so much.
No problem, by the way, would there be anything else I can help you with?
That's all for now, I'll PM u again if I have problems/concerns. Thanks You. 
You're always welcome. 
Feel free to chat me if you need anything else, Have a wonderful day, Jan! ג¨

By the way, how would you like me to call you?
I would like to have it deducted on my current bill so how do i do that? Can you facilitate?
It is system generated. 
Let's just wait for your bill to validate if it will be deducted on your first bill.

Thanks for the info, Coleen Claros! Just to confirm, did I get your full name right?
No
It's Coleena Rose L. Claros po :)
Hello
Hi! :)
What name then would you prefer?
Coleena Rose Claros :)
Got it! One last question, may I confirm if the mobile number is under your name?
No
May I confirm if these are correct? :) : name - Coleena Rose Claros, phone - the account is under your name - No. Please confirm
Yes
Thanks, Let me check my records first, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
Okay, thank you! 
Hello good morning! Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday. How may I help you today? 
Good morning! I just want to ask if you could provide me the details of my postpaid plan? Like, what promos are included?
Sure! Please wait while I pull up your account.
Okay, thanks! :)
Your plan comes with the following inclusion:
-Built-in Unli Call and Text to Globe/TM 
-Pack - GoSURF (3GB) with free Spotify Premium
-Unlitext All Net Pack 
-Consumable Pack 
Consumable Pack can be transferred to other globe sim?
Nope. You can only use it when calling other networks, register to GoSurf promo incase you've used up all your allocated data. 
Oh, I see. So if I share a load to other sim, there would be an additional charge to my bill?
Yup. Share a load transactions will be added on top of your bill.
How about Spotify? How do I activate my free spotify premium?
Kindly visit and enter your Globe postpaid number. 
I already tried that but everytime i press the send button, the page just reloads itself.
Oh wait, I tried again and they sent me a code. ג˜÷
Saving music offline on Spotify won't cost me anything, right? 
Just enter the code to the web and follow the procedure and you'll be registered in no time. 
Nope. It's one of the benefits of Spotify premium. So you can save music offline as much as you want. 
I haven't heard from you in a while. Just wanna know if you need anything?
Thanks for assisting me earlier! :) It was indicated that my spotify premium will expire on march I just want to know if there will still be free spotify premium after that? 
Ahh, after the free 3 months, you will to choose it's either to end the subscription or to start a new. 
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Good morning! You have credit adjustment.
How about the double charges for Go Surf?
There is an Email sent to the authorized person for the credit adjustment, and I'm still waiting for the feedback.
You mean authorized person to do the necessary adjustment? right?
Can you CC me on the email? is that possibel?
I can do the adjustment but I have to ask for verification. And I can't CC you on that Email,it's confidential.
Okay. So you mean you send it to the authorized person of the account? Sorry. I just want to clarify. Because the email address registered on this account is mine. And I haven't received anything yet.
No. To the department who need to clarify for the charges that's been charged to you.
Okay Thanks. Will look forward on your update. I'm sorry it's just that I'm very frustrated right now. I wanted this to be resolved asap so that I wont keep bothering you guys over and over.

Thanks for the info, Lanz Espinoza! Just to confirm, did I get your full name right?

I'm back! 
May I call you Lanz? Do you have concern regarding your plan? I'm here to help you! 
Just call me lanz,,,anong ibig mong sabihin ng exclussive yung messenger sa plan ko?
Nice meeting you, Lanz! 
Ha? Ako ang nagsabi? 
Anyway, ang ibig sabihin nun is hindi kasama sa plan mo yung Messenger. Kaya everytime na gagamit ka nito, it's either mababawasan yung GoSURF MB mo or magcha-charge yung usage mo on top of your bill. 
I mean ano pong ibig sabihin ng exclusive yung messenger sa free ng facebook bka kc mkadagdagan yung amount nang plan ko.
Di ba may 3gb na internet naman na ksali sa plan ko..
Yes, meron kang 3GB na data na pwede mong gamitin sa internet surfing mo. 
Pero wala kang FREE Facebook ah.
Bale, everytime na mag oopen ka ng FB or Messenger, mababawas yun sa 3GB.
Ah ganun ba yun kahit na free fb yung gagamitin ko mabawasan pa rin yung 3gb ko?
Ano kc diba my free fb naman sa globe kaso nga lang di mo maview yung pic kahit na yun ang gagamitin ko bawad pa rin yun sa 3gb ko?
Hmmm.. Hindi kasi natin masasabi. Ganito nalang, I suggest na i-monitor mo yung data usages mo everytime na gagamit ka ng Facebook.
Since wala ka kasing FREE Facebook sa plan inclusion mo, automatic na yun na kapag nag-open ka ng FB, mababawas yun sa data allowance mo. 
Iג€™m done for today! We can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want. Have a wonderful day! 
Thank you for your message.
I see that you want to fix internet on device, I'm still learning, Let me see if I can connect you with one of our experts...

HAPPY NEW YEAR PO....
Yep, pwede mo namang gamitin yung data mo sa Postpaid number mo. But if Facebook na App ang gagamitin mo, mababawas din 'to sa data allocation mo or possibly mag charge on top. 
Paki monitor na lang from time to time yung data usage para maiwasan ang charges through Download GServices in App store or visit My Account in Globe webite. 
Ok po slmat....
May maitutulong pa ba ko sayo? 
Wla n po s ngaun...try q nlng po gawin ung cnsbi nyo n time to time q tngnan data usage q...slmat po uli.
That's right! Thank you, Melissa! Message mo lang ako kung may mga concern ka pa. Happy Holidays! Enjoy the rest of the day!

Hi ms. Gie..
May tanong po ulit ako.. sabi po kasi nung nag cashout ako un na daw ung advance payment ko for the first month.. alin po ung totoo? Thanks
Hmm... Let me check your plan details for you.
Ok.. thanks
Hi, MirRa! 
Yung cash out is para sa device.

But as checked sa account mo, yung binayad mo is not for device cash out. 
Advance payment yun na required bayaran.
I got no response from you.

Ues, I want my share-a-load to be locked. Is there any way you can lock it?
Also, Is there anyway I would be prompted if I almost reach my data usage which is 3GB?
Just type REG <4-character PIN> <4-10-character PIN clue> and send to P1 will be charged for this transaction.
And for your data usage, you can check your data usages via or download My Data Manager app.
I could use that pin whenever I wanna share-a-load? Is that right?
Yes. 
I did not understand. Theres a 4 digit character pin? And theres also 4-10 character pin? 2 characters pin in all? Pls educate me
The 4 digit character PIN is your PIN and the 4 - 10 is your clue like for example: REG Birthday.

Hi gie
Hi! :)
How will i know if i have my plan limit like my data plan
Thank you for your message.
If i have reach my plan limit**
Hmm... Let me check your plan details for you.
Any update?
Why do i receive this message?
I have not availed any of that
You can check your bill, data usage, subscription and a lots of stuffs through the following:1. Download G services app. in play store.2. Visit My Account in Globe website.3.ֲ Dial 
The problem is that i have not availed any of that subscription. Why y was billed again for 50php
4 digit subscription does not require you to subscribe. Like if for example you are visiting some app or site, then there's an add or some pop-up. Often times you mistakenly click it, then you are automatically subscribed to it without knowing.
If I may suggest, kindly opt-out to avoid being charged again.
But still it will be included in my billing statement, right?
Yes, it will be in your upcoming bill.
Still need my help? Just chat me, and I'd be there for you.ֲ 
Nothing else
Okay! Just send me a message if you need my help regarding your Globe Postpaid plan. Enjoy the rest of your day!
Ok thanks...

Bakit po ganun pumunta kmi sa globe dito sa sta.lucia sabi ba nmn pumunta kami sa sm masinag samsung pra macheck daw kung may problema yung unit ko.Eh di ba covered pa ng 1 week replacement yung unit ko nung december 23 lng naideliver sa akin tong samsung galaxy j5
Kailan naka date ang resibo mo sa device you have availed?
Mas mapapadali ang process ng pag check ng device mo if sa samsung service center mo yan ipinacheck.
The start date of counting ng 7days replacement is the date kung kailan mo na receive ang receipt ng device mo.
Nung dec.23 ko na receive ung unit
Bakit ganun for monitoring pa daw nakita nmn sa sm taytay na humihina ung light pag nag call
Sa inis ko di ko na lang iniwan.Di katulad sa sun nung binalik ko yung unit ko ng wala pang 1 week ora mismo pinalitan nila katulad din sa inyo na 1 week replacement pag may nakitang defect sa unit di na kailangan ng monitoring kasi covered nmn ng 1 week replacement
Sensya na kung naikumpara ko kayo sa sun kasi may line din ako sa sun cellular
Okay lang, kainlan mo ba pinacheck phone mo? kasi kahapon lang ang last day ng 7 days replacement.
Kahapon
Di ba ngayon palang ang pang 7 days
Kasi dec.23 sya naideliver sa akin
Kaya dun palang tatakbo yung 7 days replacement
Ang counting ng 7 days replacement is the day kung when na punta sayo ang device, so ika 8 days ngayon. Ipacheck mo ang device mo sa SM Masinag kung san ka nila pinapapunta.
May tanong ka pa ba?

Good morning hindi na po kyo repky
Hello
Hello Gie
Good morning! 
As I mentioned kahapon subject for approval pa kung sasama sa bill mo yung cash out mo. 
Akala ko naman po okay na
Kailan ko malalaman
Paano kung hindi approve un po kasi ung pinagsasabi sa akin ng Globe loyalty na pwedr ko sama sa bill
Paano ko ba malalaman
?
Baka pwede naman mo ko matulongan doon
Tagal tagal na ko nakikipagusap sa inyo lahat
Globe Loyalty supervisor ninyo hangang ngaun wala tawag
Kailan ko po ba malalaman
PakiLinaw naman po tagal tagal ko nadin nakikipagusap kung hindi sayo pati a hotline ..
?
Matutulongan mo ba ako doon o hindi?
Parang wala din yata ako mapapala
Okay sige tawag na lang ako sa CustomerCare ninyo... salamt
Ganito kasi yun Pat, pwede naman kasi talaga na yung handset cash out is via staggard payment and will be included in your plan. However, the requirements such as how much the account is tenured, and your financial capability, is for the Loyalty department to decide.
Even though how much I wanted to help you, you would still need the approval of that. 
Paki contact na lang yung kausap ko ka Globe loyalty na supervisor kung hindi ko din ako matutulongan sa gusto ko kung tutusin naman hindi ko naman pagkakamali ito eh.. un na lang itulong ninyo sa akin natawagan ako ng supervisor na nagcommit na tatawag sa akin
Hindi kasi kami pwede mag call out.
Okay hindi ninyo po ako matutulongan.. tagal na ako nakikipagusap sayo at sa mga agent.. paikot ikot lang...
Kailangan kasi talaga ng permission ng Loyalty department e. Pasensya.
Pakisabi doon sa loyalty Department supervisor na sabi tatawagan ako kahapon pa.. pakitawagan nanako kasi hindi ko alam sino talaga tao pwede ko kauspain sa inyo.. nangyayari pura pinagpapasahan lang ako
Pakisabi doon sa loyalty Department supervisor na sabi tatawagan ako kahapon pa.. pakitawagan nanako kasi hindi ko alam sino talaga tao pwede ko kauspain sa inyo.. nangyayari pura pinagpapasahan lang ako
Limited lang kasi yung access ko and hindi ko kasi pwedeng i - contact ang Loyalty department, since ibang channel of service yun.
Thanks
Yan yung chat mo before po
Asan na po yung Tamang department na tutulong sa akin?
Asan po
Ah, OK. I can create a report, however I can't directly call out for a supervisor of that department.
I will create a report regarding to this, see what I can do, and contact you immediately as soon as I got a response.
Report san department? And kailan ko nnmn po marecieve yung tao tutulong sa skin
I- chachat kita mismo, whenever I recieve a response from my support group who can coordinate Loyalty Department for you.
Ok
Cge, enjoy your New Year muna. 
Happy Holidays. 
Paano ko makaenjoy mam dec 19 p po un
Problema
Pasensya na talga. I'll assure na lang na I'll coordinate with you. 
I already have done creating a report regarding to your concern. There might be delay of response due to holiday season, However, I will coordinate with you immediately as soon as I received a response.

You have a total unbilled balance of this includes a call and text to other networks.
Is this not included to here???
Bcs this is confusing.. you said I have that amount to pay and now I have another amount to pay..
Let's just wait for the bill to generate. The amount I'm giving you earlier is your unbilled balance which means that is the charges on top of your monthly bill.
But my payment is now posted.
??????
It can be system error. That is why I'm suggesting to let's wait for the bill for us to see if it was really charged on you.

I have just availed my plan last 24 and was activated the next day. I have received that message just today. I have not subscribed to anything except for my premium spotify which I availed as freebie from globe. I only used facebook and safari for the past few days. I have already paid my plan. Therefore I should already be enjoying it right from the day it was activated. That bill is very much unacceptable.
Can you please check my true bill? I believe that is really not my bill.

And for your information, my area is already LTE!
But why EDGE is the only data network I have! So fuck you, Globe!
If you won't fix this as soon as possibly could, we will find a way to spread the bad satisfaction you gave us...
You're really disappointing us, Globe!
Hi! We noticed that your data usage today has been really high. We're now reducing your browsing speed to maintain quality service for all Globe users. Please be guided by our Fair Use Policy at To browse at normal speed, unsubscribe from your current promo by texting STOP <PROMO> to Regular browsing rate will apply after. You can also register to GoSURF by texting the keyword to 
GS50- for 3 days, P50
 for 5 days, P50
What the hell is this??!!
Fuck Ur Policy!
Fuck your poor services!
Good day, Lucatiel! Yeah, I received your messages and found out that you are really disappointed. But don't worry, I am here and willing to hear more of your concern.
To verify, may I have your Globe postpaid number for me to check further your account? Thank you.
Yes ...so disappointing! Here's my number if you want to cut it off, its better than suffering on this shit.
May I also get your account name? Thanks. 
Celestino V. Silagan, Jr.
Its my father's name actually.
Okay, how can I help you today?
As of now, Globe held my data package...because they said I'm already at my capacity of 6gb.
Anyway, I'm sorry for the bad language! I'm just so so disappointed globe. As a costumer you should have gave us more service that will satisfy your costumers.
I hope you all should realize that not for the money but for the people!
If I'm the president of your company I'll ensure my costumers will be so satisfied that no one might complain.
I was once in Korea for 3 months, their data is so fast there with no limitations or capping. True they have prohibited and closed some of illegal sites like pirate bay, porn tube, etc. To avoid piracy and pornography but at least their service provides more better service than Globe's!
Because they want to serve their costumers than taking their money.
I hope Globe will realize that. Not only for the people but for the country...to become at least the ""no. 1 telecom in the Philippines!"
Yeah! I understand you. 
But as reviewing your account you are subscribed to GoSURF (6GB) with Free Spotify Premium.
Now, you exceed your data allocation now, and it says here that you also call to other network so that's why you have unbilled charges.
I advised to monitor your usage to avoid charges.
I got no response from you. Would you still need my help? 
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
Ok
Thanks for your message, but Iג€™m not available at the moment. Will be happy to chat 9:00 AM-5:30 PM daily. You can send your message while Iג€™m out and I will get back to you soonest.

I need a help on my complaint
Yes, may I know your complaint, Randy? You can tell me how can I help you.
Please check my other number I requested for transfer of ownership last feb at sm masinag. They did not process my request. I thought it was already approved. Then lasy Nov i already have a payable like 19k. Damn. I complain like 10 times still no answer.
As checked, you already agreed to get a new line instead of transfer of ownership. 
Agree for a new line?
Can u show me proo? My name is under your law firm. Then you tell me about this. Omg!!
Sorry for the confusion. I mean you were offered a new line instead of transfer of ownership. 
No offer was given
My question is why did you not process my request?
One of you managers promise to call me 3 weeks ago. Still no update
Let me do my best to figure this out for you. I'll just forward your account for further checking and get back to you once I receive a feedback about your concern. 
I'm done for today! But we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Free access to Messenger? 'Yung message ko ba 'yan? Haha! 
Yep
Yes how do you access that
And what is my running data usage btw
I enrolled to gosurf50 yesterday
Gie?
Are you still there?
Ah! The message just notify you that you can ask me regarding to your Globe postpaid plan. 
Bat ka nag-register ng GoSurf50?
Dahil sa pag-register mo charge on top na yan sa bill mo.
Kung yung GoSurf 99 mo naubos bago mag cut-off date makaka-pag internet ka pa rin naman eh kaso charge on top pa rin yun.
Pero kung hindi naubos yung MB mo after your cut-off date mo. Mag-rerefresh naman yung GoSurf mo eh. No need to register.
I got no response from you. Would you still need my help? 
Insee
So whats my running data usage na ba
Sa ngayon wala ka ng remaining data allocation. Pero still makaka-pag internet ka pa rin yun lang charge on top kana.
How.much per mb?
P2.00 per MB.
Ohh do i have excess na?
Yes. 
How much na ang excess ko
?
P21.42 na.
Okay okay
May maitutulong pa ba ako?
Okay thanks
Okay! Feel free to message me. Happy new year!

Thank you for letting me know, Belmark. 
This is due to a system issue but don't worry, steps are now being taken to address this matter. 
I already forwarded your details to the appropriate team and rest assured that this will be resolved the soonest possible time.
You may still try to register from time to time, to monitor changes.
Yes, the globe site still wont send me an activation code
I understand, Belmark. It's due to system activity. 
As advised, you may still try to register from time to time, to monitor changes.
Cant you just activate me manually in your end?
I can also try registering your mobile number to the link I've given to you but the rest should be done on your end.
Done! 
Have you received a code?
I received an activation code. I entered it here But it says invalid code
Note that i login to spotify using facebook (if this matters)
Also, another concern. My plan is an iphone7, when charging my phone i feel this slight vibration when touching the back of the phone when its plugin. Should I ask for a replacement?
Illbe back in an hour. Just leave instructions. Thanks
I see. It's still part of the system activity.
Regarding your phone, I suggest that you visit PowerMac or any authorized Apple re-seller to have your phone checked. 
I got no response from you.
Just wanna know if you still need help with anything?
Im going to the apple store. Ill let you know if i need anything. Thanks

That great. Kaso how do i access it? Seems like its not automatically accessed when i downloaded the app.
Do i need to register or something?

bakit ganon ung plan ko then bigla magiging hndi pa naman ako lumampas sa data limiy ko...
Ang plan mo is still under myLifestyle plan But since we have a promo that offers a Php discount for customers na kumuha ng myLifestyle Line. Thatג€™s why you need to pay Php lang.

Thanks for your message, but Iג€™m not available at the moment. Will be happy to chat 9:00 AM-5:30 PM daily. You can send your message while Iג€™m out and I will get back to you soonest.
Hindi kasi siya pwede i-adjust since yun na kasi yung allocated data allowance mo. 
Magamit mo man siya o hindi fix and babayaran mo sa plan mo + charge on top sa bill mo. 
Pero wag ka mag alala every 24th of the month mag re-refresh ang data mo. 
I got no response from you, I just want to know if you still need my help? 
Ang pde i adjust ung hindi ko nagmit na data tama?m
Nope, since wala kang GoSurf Roll Over magamit mo man o hindi ang data usage mo every 24th 3GB padin ang data mo. 
Ikaw kya nG sabi
Okay linawin ko lang pwede siya ma adjust like if kunyari hindi mo magamit yung itong month for the following month ma carry over yun basta may GoSurf roll over ka. 
Ano ung gosurf roll over??
Pwede ko ilagay yun sayo pwede the advisable date of plan modification or changing of promo packs is on or before the bill cut-off date to avoid double charges.
pero*
Pero ano??
Explain ko ng maayos. 
And data roll over ay may capability to extend the validity of your unused GoSURF personal data allowance for another month.
Since hindi ka naka-register for that yung data mo magamit mo man o hindi, ma-forfeit siya. 
Kitam mo kdyaan ng globe my gnyan pla hindi man ln pinliwanag
Ngayon, pwede kong lagyan yung plan mo ng GoSurf Roll Over pero yung freebies mo mawawala. 
Ok ln go
I understand what you feel, kaya nga ngayon ine-explain ko siya sayo. 
Cge lgyan mo na
Pero since tapos na ang cut-off date mo hindi siya pwedeng i-modify kasi pwede kang ma-double charge. 
Ganun?? Grabe bkit ngaun ln yan dpt maaga pa ln pagkuha pa ln ng cp naipaliwang na nila
Ngaun magbbyad ako ng1k na hindi ko man magmot
Naiintindihan kita pero nakalagay kasi yan sa website. 
No.... Hindi dhilan un, paano kung ung taong nag plan hindi marunong maginternet.. Tas gnung nangyyri sa data nya at lumalaki ng bayad, tingin niu mttuwa sya pag gnun, lalo hindi pla naipaliwanag nung kumuha sya ng plan
Malaki kagaguhan tlga ginwa niu,
This is sucks
I'm really sorry for that. 
Pero pag malapit na ang bill cut-off date mo pwede ko na ilagay ang Go Surf Roll over. 
Wag ka na magalit. 
Bwucit
Huwag ka mag alala hindi na ito mauulit. 
Sa ngayon monitor mo nalang ang usage mo para hindi ka ma-charge on top ng bill mo. 
Kya lahi kayo hindi binbyran kasi d niu pinpaliwag ng mabuto
Sorry na, naipaliwanag ko naman siya ngayon ng maayos diba? 
Kung kailan cut oof
Pasensya na ha? peace natayo. 
Urur
Grabe ka naman. 
Hindi mo ba ako mapapatawad? 
Chat mo nalang ako kung may maitutulong pa ako sayo, happy new year! ג¨

Thanks for your message, but Iג€™m not available at the moment. Will be happy to chat 9:00 AM-5:30 PM daily. You can send your message while Iג€™m out and I will get back to you soonest.
Globe Morning, Mack! It is actually free. 
But the advisable date of plan modification or changing of promo packs is on or before the bill cut-off date to avoid double charges.
will it affect my plan?
Yes, you will no longer have freebies if I put GoSurf Roll over in your plan. 
I got no response from you, I just want to know if you still need my help? 
what are again my freebies?
You have Free Spotify Premium and Free access to Facebook. 
Don't worry, once I already change your account in GoSurf Roll over you still have Free Facebook but you will no longer have Spotify Premium. 
can you explain to me more of this roll over? :)
Yes, sure. 
Data roll over is the capability to extend the validity of your unused GoSURF personal data allowance for another month.
so just one month?
Any unused data can only roll over for a maximum of 1 month (up to the 2nd month). If this remains unused on the 3rd month, the rolled over data becomes forfeited. 
if i enrol to roll over my spotify premium will be removed?
Yes, it will. 
my spotify premium is good for 24 months?
Nope, it is just free for 3 months. 
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?
okay, is the data roll over automatic or are there manual subscriptions to be done?
Once I already include it in your plan it will be fixed.
I'm done for today, if you have questions or concern let's continue out chat tomorrow.
Hai maam gudeve..can i ask you po..

Globe Morning, Renali. 
Ang ibigsabihin mo ba yung total amount na kailangan niyo bayaran?
Meron pa ba akong maitutulong sayo? 
Bukod po dun sa monthly nmen maam..my nadagdag po ba
Depende yun sa usage mo, for example tumawag ka other network or nag text that would be charge on top sa bill mo. 
Ok mam tanx
Kapag naubos na data allowance mo ma-charge na din yun on top sa bill mo. 
Kaya dapat lagi mo din siya i-monitor. 
Meron pa ba akong maitutulong sayo?
Iג€™m almost done for today! Iג€™ll be here with you a bit longer, but we can continue to talk tomorrow at 9:00 AM if you want?

Good evening. Still very weak 4g signal in our area. Promenade Mahogany, Brgy Pulo (near barangay sa isidro), Cabuyao Laguna. Along National road. 4g is ok as long as you are not under anything. Being inside the house, inside the car, on board a tricycle or just being under anything negates the 4g signal. Is this how it is really? Pls help. Thanks.

What date is my first billing cycle?
The start date of your billing cycle would be every 27th of the month. 
But it should be the 18th of month right? I got this phone on the 18th of December
Yes, but the start date of your billing cycle is 27th so the will be pro-rated. 
Expect it on your first billing cycle. 
But my data will be back to 10gb on the 18th?or 27th?
It is on the 27th. 
What will happen if my 10gb will be out already before the 27th?im i going to be overcharge?or i can't use any data anymore and wait for the 27th to get back the data?
Yes, once you consumed your data allocation, every browse would be charge on top of your bill. 
I suggest that always monitor your data usage.

I upgrade my internet because your services were so slow, but it's still the same, can't even talk to my husband because of the poor connection, can you do something about that, because it's driving me insane, I've been paying so much but still the same poor connection!
I have a pocket wifi and the same time a plan on my phone! But still can't even make a call. Can you improve the connection ?? Or else I will not be paying it anymore even tho my plan has a 2 years contract, my messages to you can't even send right away!
Please talk to the in charge about my problem! Really been experiencing this for almost 3 months now, that's why even tho I have a pocket wifi I was still forced to get another plan because I thought it will help. But it's worst the 3G and the wifi has really poor connection..
I just pay my pocket wifi last 26th of this month. But I still have the same poor connection. Cmon globe, I've been paying two accounts, just for me to have a good internet. But what?? What can you do about that?

May I know your exact location? Do you experience this inside or outside your house? 
Inside and outside of the house,
Macamias guimba nuevA ecija,
Macamias guimba nuevA ecija,
Can you put it back to plan , I paid it already and
As checked, your area has no outage. But the signal there is really poor. Our team is doing their best to fix this.
So it doesn't matter if I used your highest paid pocket wifi or 3G? Ganun pa rin kahit na dala dalawa ang internet ko?
But some of my husbands family here were using globe, and sabi nila malakas naman daw po connection nila,
They're using the prepaid tho
Na-eexperience mo din ba 'to sa ibang area?
Nope, pag NASA bayan ako mabilis siya,
Ang nakakainis po kasi kung kailan kami mag uusap ng asawa ko tsaka pa lage ng reconnecting ang signal, that's 7pm-8pm. Isang oras Lang sana kasi yun pa ang mahina, sa umaga sometimes mabilis but most of the time sobrang bagal.
Don't care if mahina siya sa umaga, what's my concern is makapag usap kami ng asawa ko, pero it seems like that time pa ang super slow.
Sorry for the inconvenience. I understand you, Elieza. Ginagawan na ng way para maging okay yung signal sa area nyo. 
Okay thank you so much but about dun sa pinapa upgrade ko? Sabi mo kasi pag nabayaran ko na pwede ko na ipabalik sa 
I just paid last 26th
Pwede ko ba malaman yung account number ng pocket wWiFi mo?
Hold a sec
Okay. May I also know the reference number?
Where can I find the reference number?
The reference number for your downgrade?
Okay hanapin ko Lang po saglit
Okay. Sa'yo din ba nakapangalan 'to?
Opo
Okay. Check ko lang.
Okay po thank you
As checked, walang lumabas sa system namin under your name and account number.
Panong walang lumabas? Elieza rose h Samonte
Panong walang lumabas? Elieza rose h Samonte
J.
My wifi connection is 2 years ko ng binabayaran. Sa cebu ko pa inapply to. Panong walang pangalan na lumabas sakin?
Oops. Sorry, Velasco yung nilalagay ko. Hehe.
Hindi Velasco gamit ko, Samonte pa po pangalan ko nung nag apply po ako, pero itong sa phone ko na na internet sa sm tarlac ko na po to inapply..
Kaso both connection poor talaga siya, sana magawan ng paraan n umabot dito sa place namin ang signal kasi most of the people here are globe users
At globe Lang daw malakas dito.
Check ko na lang ulit bukas kasi mag-ask pa ko for help. Wala kasi akong access eh. Hehe. Yes, Elieza. 
At globe Lang may signal, yung iba hahanapin pa
Hmm. What do you mean? Anyway, can we continue chatting tomorrow? Cause i'm done for today.

Ang unbilled charges ay hindi macha-charge on top sa bill mo. Ito yung running balance mo after ng last cut-off date up to the current date. 
Paano ko po mlalaman kng my available balance pa ako??
Diba nag-set kami ng spending limit mo? Makaka-receive ka naman ng notification kung magkano na ang running unbilled charges mo. Pero kung gusto mo talaga itong i-check from time to time, mag-log in lang sa My Account para ma-monitor mo ito.
Ok po..tnx po ng marami...happy new year & godbless po

If you have a different nickname, just let me know. 
Sure
To activate your free Spotify Premium, please visit the link and enter your 11-digit number. 
I tried doing that but the page just reloads to this.
I really can't activate it. I also have free Netflix which is easier to activate since they texted me too. Spotify or Globe on the other hand has not texted me regarding my free 3 months Spotify for availing plan 
Try to clear your cache first. 
I tried doing that but it just reloads to the screen that I showed earlier.
I see. It's still due to the system issue. Don't worry, steps are now being taken to address this matter and rest assured that it'll be resolved the soonest possible time. I also forwarded your details, you may still try to register from time to time to monitor changes.

When? My account was deactivated yesterday because I reached the spending limit of I called yesterdag and was informed that credit limit does not affect the spending limit
 is your spending limit, isn't it?
Yes.
How can I increase that with the same amount of my credit limit?
Spending limit should always be lower than the credit limit.
Okay. Since my credit limit was can I increase my spending limit to 
No, it's not possible. There is a corresponding amount of spending limit per credit limit.
Ok so eventhough my credit limit was increase to My spending will retain to and will never increase?
Yes. Since, it has a corresponding spending limit.
That sucks
Sorry for that. But would there be anything else?

My phone's home button doesn't work. It has no sound too after being slightly dipped to the water. I thought iPhone 7 plus is water resistant. Anyway, i'm under gadget care plan. How can I avail it?
You can go to the nearest Globe Store to have them check your phone, and they will guide you through. They'll also know your gadget care once they have checked your account.
And if you want, you can also mention to them your gadget care subscription. 
Any globe store? It's isn't necessary naman don sa mismong branch where I got my phone no?
Yes, but don't be shocked if they advised you to go to other Globe store branch. Because often times, yung availability ng gadget care may vary.
Ipapa-check mo lang naman din ang unit mo, so no need na to go to where you have availed your handset. 
Meron pa ba akong ibang matutulong sayo, Jen?

Gie?
Sorry sa late response.
Di ba pwede ilipat sa ibong phone ung globe postpaid sim
Pwede mo namn e-insert and Postpaid SIM sa ibang device basta compatible ang SIM sa SIM slot.
Kung Micro SIM sa Micro Slot ganun.
Pero gie aYaw gumana pag nilagyan ng ibang globe emergency call lng pero pag smart ok man
Yung postpaid ayaw gumana sa ibang phone away mag apear ng contact phonebook not available daw pero sa ibang sim ok man
Baka namn hindi Globe Compatible ang device. I mean hindi siya open line for Globe.
Compatible siya sa globe kc dun galing yung postpaid
Okay, sa anong device mo ba nilipat ang Postpaid SIM?
Samsung na keypad lng
Ahh, try mo daw e-insert sa iba pang device.

You can check your data usage through the following: 1. Download G services app. in play store.2. Visit My Account in Globe website.3. Dial 
You will also be notified when you are already exceeded to your data allowance.
Anything else?
How about my pesos consumables? How can i know if i've exceeded or not
Right now, the only way you may track your remaining consumable amount is by monitoring your unbilled charges by dialing choose MyAccount then Unbilled Charges.
Consumable minus your unbilled charges equals your remaining consumable.
Anything else?
That will do for now. Big thanks. Can I reach you some other time if the need arises?
You are welcome and have a great day!

Hello po. Tanong ko lang po if pwede po magshare ng load at kung magkano ang load na dadaring sakin every month?
Sa plan po
Walang literal na load ang Postpaid. Tsaka kapag nag share ka ng ""load"", macha-charge on top 'yun.
May free text po ba sa ibang network?
Walang free texts to other network e.
Pwede ko bang makuha 'yung full name mo at 'yung Globe Postpaid number mo?

Pwede naman. Basta kaya ng credit limit mo.
Magkano po ba ang maximum?

Wala naman maximum limit. Basta kayanin lang ng credit limit.

Hi! :)
my problema sa postpaid sim ko
Anong problema ng SIM mo?
kasi mam. nag pa anti billing shock ako! sa postpaid sim ko! naka 6GB ako! ehh ynug na cinsumed ko na yugn 6GB d na ako nakagamit ng net! ang akala ko kasi tuloy tuloy na yun at fixed na sa kasi naka ABS ako
anti billing shock. 3x ko ng itinawag yun
pwede ko ba ipa no limit yun? salamat
Huwag mo na munang gamitin kung hindi mo sya magamit. Hintayin natin 'yung bill mo para malaman natin 'yung mga charges.
Pwede ko din bang malaman kung nag Share-A-Load ka?
hindi po
O sige. Standby ka lang, ha? Ilalapit ko muna ito sa support.
simula ng binayaran ko yun! ng nung 28 mam!
gumamit lng ako ng 3mins call sa smart tapos wala na!
okay naman yugn sim! activated naman! ang problem is yugn internet ko 6GB po ubos na! ehh pina Anti billing shock ko po yun! pero bakit wala ng net? kala ko ba dere-deretso yun hanggang sa mag mareach ko yung ko no limit po
Oo, sige. Pasensya na. Nagkaroon kasi Share-A-Load transaction according sa system. Pero gagawan ko ng paraan to.
tapos na sa issue na yan mam! nabayran ko na po nugn dec 28! ehh yugn share a laod issue na yan eh nung dec 26 or 27 pa
hindi po ba pwede i process sakin para sa no limit mam? kasi yung CSR na kausap ko kanina eh! pinapupunta ako sa globe para ipa no limit dun
Oo, pero dahil dun sa Share-A-Load na 'yun kaya hindi ka makapag internet. Kasi nga nag exceed sa spending limit. Kaya nga gagawa ako ng email regarding sa concern mo.
ay ganon??? ehh samantalng na process nyo na kahapon yung sa isue ko na yan mam! at bayad na! binayaran ko na nung dec 28. via gcash! at naayus na
May unbilled pa nga kasi sa records mo, kaya inaayos. 
ay ganon ba? grabe nmn mam! haha at pa taas na din ng spendlimit mam. kausap ko na kanina sa csr d nila naayus haha ang gulo
Haha. Magkaiba kasi kami ng CSR e. Chat ako, calls naman sila. Magpapa increase ka ng spending limit?
yup .para hindi laging ganyan mam masyadong nakakaabala eh
my bayad ba?? sakto nyo po sa 
Wala naman bayad kapag i-increase 'yung spending limit. Ang kailangan lang is ipa increase mo 'yung credit limit mo para mag increase na din 'yung spending limit.
ay mam 2k na yung creditlimit ko
Automatic kasing tataas 'yung spending limit kapag nagpa increase ng credit limit.
ehh bakit mam hindi tumaas
Wala namang request for increase ng credit limit sa account mo.
bakit ganon?? ehh binayaran ko pa yan para ma activate agad
my binigay sakin no.. d ko alam kung para saan yun
yan oh
Wait lang pala. Kaano-ano mo 'yung account holder?
Kelan ka nag request ng credit limit increase? Saan? 
wife ko mam may kausap na ako agent mam okay na po salamat
Okay. May maitutulong pa ba ako? 
wala na po mama salamat po

Sure thing!
Hello, Lou! For the account number that you gave, the account is already cancelled.
Yes the account has been terminated already. I am asking if the charges have been reversed because i was being charged for early terminated of the account.
No, the charge won't be reversed. Because you will be a charge for that. You need to pay the pre-termination in order to terminate the account. Since the account comes with a handset availed.
But that mistake is made by your staff. I inquired about the date of termination so that I will finish the contract first. He assured me that it will be terminated on the date that i will be done with the lock in period - sept. 5, So that is no longer my fault if it was supposed to be sept.6, which is only a day shy of the contract.
What should be the date that your contract ends, according to the personnel? 
And as checked, you still have a balance of 
The agent said the contract ends sept.5 so i asked him to process the termination as soon as the lock in period ends. He assured me that he will do so. But i was still charged with a pretermination penalty which is why I still have the balance of That is what i have been requesting to be reversed since that is not my fault. Why would i wait for 2 years only to preterminate the contract with only 1 more day remaining?
Unfortunately, there are no notes regarding to your account's termination. As of now, the charges are deemed valid. 
These are reflected as processing fee of the termination of your plan.
In that case, i will also proceed to terminating my other globe accounts as soon as the lock in period is over. Your customer service sucks. I inquired about the date of termination before i had it terminated. So that is not my fault if the date was wrong. Who would terminate one day ahead of actual end of contract? I waited for two years and then i will terminate just one day ahead? That is the most stupid act if ever. You should be more considerate than that if you wish to keep your customers.
I know how you feel, Lou. As checked this are for the processing fee of terminating your plan and you just need to settle it. I wouldn't want you to feel this.
I have terminated plans with other networks and even with globe before and there were no processing fees for that. How come there is a processing fee now? Plus it should have been computed on my last bill and deducted from the advanced monthly fee that have been initially charged. Why bill me months after the termination?
Sorry for the confusion. As I checked further with your account, I can waived the admin which is However, you have valid charges such as SMS transaction to Globe, and other networks, which you need to settle. 
If they are valid charges, i have no problem settling them. As you can see from my records, i always pay my dues. I have even enrolled this account to citibank auto debit before it was terminated. This is why i wondered why i still have unpaid accounts when it has been more than 3 months since this acct has been terminated.

Hmm as checked, here you are not charge in using Facebook, and your free Spotify it has own data allocation which is 1GB so it will not consume your data allocation.
I suggest to wait for your bill.

I'm here to help you with your Globe Postpaid plan :-)
Hi Gie.....what would be required if I will upgrade my data limit for my subscribed plan?
Thanks for reaching out! Before we start, I just have a few questions
May I please have your mobile number?
Thanks for the info, Eddie Glenn Zagada Jr.! Just to confirm, did I get your full name right?
Yes
Got it! One last question, may I confirm if the mobile number is under your name?
Yes
May I confirm if these are correct? :) : name - Eddie Glenn Zagada Jr., phone - the account is under your name - Yes. Please confirm
Yes
Thanks, Let me check my records first, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
I just need to assess if your credit limit is still enough to cover the upgrade you want.
Same also what is required if need to upgrade the credit limit
You just need to pass proof of financial capability.
Still need my help? Just chat me, and I'd be there for you.ֲ
